This is a high-throughput instrument for cell-based assays to monitor Ca2+ signaling associated with GPCRs and ion channels. Cells were seeded at a density of 5×104 cells/well in BioCoat poly-D-lysine coated, black wall, clear bottom 384-well plates (BD Biosciences, Franklin lakes, NJ, USA) and allowed to attach overnight in an incubator at 37° C. The cells were then washed twice with HBSS-HEPES buffer (Hanks' balanced salt solution without bicarbonate and phenol red, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) using an ELx405 Select CW Microplate Washer (BioTek, Winooski, Vt., USA). After 60 min of dye-loading in the dark using the Ca2+-sensitive dye Fluo-4AM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif., USA), at a final concentration of 2×10^−6M, the plates were washed 4 times with HBSS-HEPES buffer to remove excess dye and leaving 50 μl of buffer in each well. The plates were then placed in the FLIPR TETRA instrument and allowed to equilibrate at 37° C. AGN-211377 was added in a 25 μl volume to each well to give final concentrations of 0.1 μM, 0.3 μM, 1 μM, 3 μM, 10 μM, and 30 μM; or 0.067 μM, 0.1 μM, 0.2 μM, 0.3 μM, 0.67 μM, and 1 μM for cells over-expressing TP receptors. After 4.5 minutes, a 7-point serial dilution of the standard agonist for the corresponding receptor, in a 25 μl volume was injected at the final concentrations from 10^−11M to 10^−5M in 10-fold serial dilution increments for cells expressing human recombinant DP1, EP1, EP2, EP3, EP4, FP, and IP receptors. The dose range for the standard agonist for human recombinant TP receptors was from 10^−12M to 10^−6M. HBSS-HEPES buffer was used as the negative control for the standard agonists. Cells were excited with LED (light emitting diode) excitation at 470-495 nm and emission was measured through an emission filter at 515-575 nm. Assay plates were read for 3.5 minutes using the FLIPRTETRA.\",\n",

A predetermined amount of suitable hAR-expressed CHO cells was mixed with labeled ligands (1 nM [3H]CCPA and 0.5 nM [125I]AB-MECA) specifically binding to A1 and A3 adenosine receptors in a 50/10/1 buffer in test tubes . The derivatives of the present invention were dissolved at various concentrations in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and diluted in the buffer, taking care that the final concentration of DMSO did not exceed 1%. Incubation for 1 hr in a 370C incubator was followed by rapid filtration in a vacuum using a cell collector (TOMTEC, U.S.A.). Subsequently, the test tubes were washed three times with 3 ml of the buffer before radioactivity was measured using a Î³-counter.',\n",
