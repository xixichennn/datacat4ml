Radioligand Binding Assay: The inhibition constant (Ki) is determined using a radioligand binding assay (described in Bergman et. al. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2008, 18, 1425-1430).
Radioligand Binding Assays: The CB1 and CB2 radioligand binding assays described herein are utilized to ascertain the selectivity of compounds of the present application for binding to CB2 relative to CB1 receptors.HEK293 cells stably expressing human CB2 receptors were grown until a confluent monolayer was formed. Briefly, the cells were harvested and homogenized in TE buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM EDTA) using a polytron for 210 second bursts in the presence of protease inhibitors, followed by centrifugation at 45,000xg for 20 minutes. The final membrane pellet was re-homogenized in storage buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM EDTA and 10% sucrose) and frozen at -78 C. until used. Saturation binding reactions were initiated by the addition of membrane preparation (protein concentration of 5 ug/well for human CB2) into wells of a deep well plate containing [3H]CP 55,940 (120 Ci/mmol, a nonselective CB agonist commercially available from Tocris) in assay buffer.
Competitive Displacement Assay: Receptor Binding (in vitro Assay) The Ki (binding affinity) for mu-, delta-, and kippa-receptors was determined with a previously described method using a competitive displacement assay (Neumeyer, 2003). Membrane protein from CHO (Chinese Hamster Ovarian) cells that stably expressed one type of the cloned human opioid receptor were incubated with 12 different concentrations of the compound in the presence of 0.25 nM [3H]DAMGO, 0.2 nM [3H]naltrindole or 1 nM [3H]U69,593 in a final volume of 1 mL of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 at 25 C. Incubation times of 60 min were used for [3H]DAMGO and [3H]U69,593. Because of a slower association of [3H]naltrindole with the receptor, a 3 h incubation was used with this radioligand. Samples incubated with [3H]naltrindole also contained 10 mM MgCl2 and 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Nonspecific binding was measured by inclusion of 10 uM naloxone. The binding was terminated by filtering the samples through Schleicher & Schuell No. 32 glass.
Binding Assay: CHO cells (ATCC No. CCL-61), in which A1 and A3 adenosine receptors were expressed, were cultured in F-12 media (Gibco, U.S.A.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/ml and 100 Î¼g/ml), at 37Â°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. A predetermined amount of suitable hAR-expressed CHO cells was mixed with labeled ligands (1 nM [3H]CCPA and 0.5 nM [125I]AB-MECA) specifically binding to A1 and A3 adenosine receptors in a 50/10/1 buffer in test tubes . The derivatives of the present invention were dissolved at various concentrations in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and diluted in the buffer, taking care that the final concentration of DMSO did not exceed 1%. Incubation for 1 hr in a 370C incubator was followed by rapid filtration in a vacuum using a cell collector (TOMTEC, U.S.A.). Subsequently, the test tubes were washed three times with 3 ml of the buffer before radioactivity was measured using a Î³-counter.

In some instances, HEK-293 cells that express recombinant hMC1-R were employed. Assays were performed in 96 well GF/B Millipore multiscreen filtration plates (MAFB NOB10) pre-coated with 0.5% bovine serum albumin (Fraction V). Membrane homogenates were incubated with 0.2 nM (for hMC4-R) 0.4 nM (for MC3-R and MC5-R) or 0.1 nM (for mouse B16 MC1-R or hMC1-R) [I125]-NDP-alpha -MSH (Perkin Elmer) and increasing concentrations of test peptides of the present invention in buffer containing 25 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.5) with 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.3 mM 1,10-phenanthroline, and 0.2% bovine serum albumin. After incubation for 60 minutes at 37 C., the assay mixture was filtered and the membranes washed.
Radioligand Dose-Displacement Binding Assay: Radioligand dose-displacement binding assays for u-opioid receptors used 0.3 nM [3H]-diprenorphine (Perkin Elmer, Shelton, Conn.), with 5 mg membrane protein/well in a final volume of 500 ul binding buffer (10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 5% DMSO, 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4). Reactions were carried out in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled naloxone. All reactions were conducted in 96-deep well polypropylene plates for 2 hours at room temperature. Binding reactions were terminated by rapid filtration onto 96-well Unifilter GF/C filter plates (Perkin Elmer, Shelton, Conn.), presoaked in 0.5% polyethylenimine using a 96-well tissue harvester (Perkin Elmer, Shelton, Conn.) followed by performing three filtration washes with 500 ul of ice-cold binding buffer. Filter plates were subsequently dried at 50 C. for 2-3 hours. BetaScint scintillation cocktail (Perkin Elmer, Shelton, Conn.) was added (50 ul/well), and plates were counted using a Packard Top-Counter.
Binding Assay: Binding assay of certain compounds of this invention to the opioid receptor was determine using radioligand binding assay (screening and dose-displacement).

Non-specific binding was determined in the presence of 10 nM unlabeled nociceptin (American Peptide Company). All reactions were performed in 96-deep well polypropylene plates for 1 h at about 25° C. Binding reactions were terminated by rapid filtration onto 96-well Unifilter GF/C filter plates (Packard) presoaked in 0.5% polyethylenimine (Sigma).

Filter plates were subsequently dried at 50° C. for 2-3 hours. Fifty μL/well scintillation cocktail (BetaScint; Wallac) was added and plates were counted in a Packard Top-Count for 1 min/well.
Binding Assay: The receptor binding method (DeHaven and DeHaven-Hudkins, 1998) was a modification of the method of Raynor et al. (1994).
Radioligand Binding Assay: Compound potency can be assessed by a radioligand binding assay (described in Bergman et. al. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2008, 18, 1425-1430) in which the inhibition constant (Ki) is determined in membranes prepared from CHO cells expressing either the orexin-1 (OX1) or orexin-2 (OX2) receptor.
Competition Binding Assay: The rat H3 receptor was cloned and expressed in cells, and competition binding assays carried out, according to methods previously described (see Esbenshade, et al. Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics 2005, 313, 165-175; Esbenshade et al., Biochemical Pharmacology 2004, 68, 933-945; and Krueger, et al. Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics 2005, 314, 271-281). Membranes were prepared from C6 or HEK293 cells, expressing the rat histamine H3 receptor, by homogenization on ice in TE buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 5 mM EDTA), 1 mM benzamidine, 2 ug/ml aprotinin, 1 ug/ml leupeptin, and 1 ug/ml pepstatin. The homogenate was centrifuged at 40,000 g for 20 minutes at 4 C. This step was repeated, and the resulting pellet was resuspended in TE buffer. Aliquots were frozen at -70 C. until needed. On the day of assay, membranes were thawed and diluted with TE buffer.
Radioligand Binding Assay: Radioligand dose-displacement binding assays for μ-opioid receptors used 0.2 nM[3H]-diprenorphine (NEN, Boston, Mass.), with 5-20 mg membrane protein/well in a final volume of 500 μl binding buffer (10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 5% DMSO, 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4). Reactions were carried out in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled naloxone. All reactions were conducted in 96-deep well polypropylene plates for 1-2 hr at room temperature. Binding reactions were terminated by rapid filtration onto 96-well Unifilter GF/C filter plates (Packard, Meriden, Conn.) presoaked in 0.5% polyethylemimine using a 96-well tissue harvester (Brandel, Gaithersburg, Md.) followed by performing three filtration washes with 500 μl of ice-cold binding buffer. Filter plates were subsequently dried at 50° C. for 2-3 hours. BetaScint scintillation cocktail (Wallac, Turku, Finland) was added (50 μl/well), and plates were counted using a Packard Top-Count for 1 min/well.
Competitive Inhibition Assay: A competitive inhibition binding assay is performed using membrane homogenates prepared from HEK-293 cells that express recombinant hMC4-R, hMC3-R, or hMC5-R, and from B-16 mouse melanoma cells (containing endogenous MC1-R). In some instances, HEK-293 cells that express recombinant hMC1-R were employed. In the examples that follow, all MC3-R, MC4-R and MC5-R values are for human recombinant receptors. MC1-R values are for B-16 mouse melanoma cells, unless the heading is hMC1-R, in which case the value is for human recombinant MC1-R. Assays were performed in 96 well GF/B Millipore multiscreen filtration plates (MAFB NOB10) pre-coated with 0.5% bovine serum albumin (Fraction V). Membrane homogenates were incubated with 0.2 nM (for hMC4-R) 0.4 nM (for MC3-R and MC5-R) or 0.1 nM (for mouse B16 MC1-R or hMC1-R) [I125]-NDP-alpha -MSH (Perkin Elmer) and increasing concentrations of test peptides of the present invention in buffer containing 25 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.5) with 100 mM NaCl.

Binding Assay: The affinities of selected Purine Derivatives for the adenosine A1 receptor were determined by measuring the displacement of specific [3H] 2-chloro-N6-cyclopentyl adenosine binding in CHO cells stably transfected with human recombinant A1 adenosine receptor expressed as Ki (nM).
In Vitro Binding Assay: hEP1 and hEP4 membranes are prepared from recombinant HEK293 cells stably expressing the human EP1 (Genbank accession number AY275470) or EP4 (Genbank accession number AY429109) receptors. hEP2 and hEP3 membranes are prepared from HEK293 cells transiently transfected with EP2 (Genbank accession number AY275471) or EP3 (isoform VI: Genbank accession number AY429108) receptor plasmids. Frozen cell pellets are homogenized in homogenization buffer using a Teflon/glass homogenizer. Membrane protein is aliquoted and quick frozen on dry ice prior to storage at -80 C. Homogenization buffer contained 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 250 mM sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, 0.3 mM indomethacin and plus Complete, with EDTA, obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Catalog Number 1 697 498).Kd values for [3H]-PGE2 binding to each receptor are determined by saturation binding studies or homologous competition. Compounds are tested in a 96-well format using a three-fold dilution series.
Radioligand Binding: HEK293 stably expressing human orexin-2 receptor (Genebank accession number NM 001526) were grown to confluency in DMEM/F12 (Gibco, Cat #11039), in DMEM, 10% FBS, 1× Pen/Strep, 1× NaPyruvate, 1×HEPES, 600 ug/ml G418 media on 150 cm2 tissue culture plates, washed with 5 mM EDTA in PBS (HyClone Dulbecco's Phosphate Buffered Saline 1× with Calcium and Magnesium, Cat #SH30264.01, hereafter referred to simply as PBS) and scraped into 50 ml tubes. After centrifugation (2K xG, 10 min at 4° C.), the supernatant was aspirated and the pellets frozen and stored at −80° C. Cells were resuspended in PBS in the presence of 1 tablet of protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Cat. #11836145001) per 50 mL.
In Vitro Binding Assay: hEP1 and hEP4 membranes are prepared from recombinant HEK293 cells stably expressing human EP1 (Genbank accession number AY275470) or EP4 (Genbank accession number AY429109) receptors. hEP2 and hEP3 membranes are prepared from HEK293 cells transiently transfected with EP2 (Genbank accession number AY275471) or EP3 (isoform VI: Genbank accession number AY429108) receptor plasmids.

Radioligand Binding Assay: The CRTH2 receptor binding assay is performed in a scintillation proximity assay (SPA) format with the radioligand [3H]-PGD2 (Perkin Elmer, NET616000MC). CHO-K1-hCRTH2 cell membranes are again homogenized by passing through a single use needle (Terumo, 23Gx1") and diluted in SPA incubation buffer in suitable concentrations (0.5-10 ug protein/well). The SPA assay is set up in 96 well microtiter plates (Perkin Elmer, Cat No. 6005040) in SPA incubation buffer with a final volume of 200 uL per well and final concentration of 50 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA pH 7.4, 0.1% bovine serum albumin). The SPA assay mixture contains 60 ul of the membrane suspension, 80 uL of Wheat Germ Agglutinin coated PVT beads (GE Healthcare, RPNQ-0001, 0.3 mg/well), 40 uL of [3H]-PGD2 diluted in SPA buffer to a final concentration of 1 nM (50 000 dpm) and 20 uL of the test compound (dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide). The SPA assay mixture is incubated for 3 h at room temperature.
In Vitro Inhibition Assay: The Invitrogen (Carlsbad, Calif.) mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) Lanthascreen assay can be used to quantitate mTOR kinase activity in an in vitro setting. Active mTOR phosphorylates eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) on residue threonine 46. This phosphorylation event can be detected with a phospho-specific terbium (Tb) labeled Ab, in turn bringing the Tb label in close proximity to the GFP tagged 4E-BP1 and allowing for time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET), which correlates 4E-BP1 phosphorylation levels with mTOR kinase activity.
Functional Assay: The ability of the compounds to bind and interact with the human H3 receptor as agonists, inverse agonists and/or antagonists, is determined by a functional assay, named [35S]GTPgammaS assay. The assay measures the activation of G proteins by catalyzing the exchange of guanosine 5'-diphosphate (GDP) by guanosine 5' -triphosphate (GTP) at the -subunit. The GTP-bounded G proteins dissociate into two subunits, GGTP and Gbetagamma, which in turn regulate intracellular enzymes and ion channels. GTP is rapidly hydrolysed by the G-sub-unit (GTPases) and the G protein is deactivated and ready for a new GTP exchange cycle. To study the function of ligand-induced G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) activation by an increase in guanine nucleotide exchange at the G proteins, the binding of [35S]-guanosine-5'-O-(3-thio)triphosphate [35S] GTPgamma, a non-hydrolysed analogue of GTP, is determined.
Receptor Binding Assay: The experiment was carried out according to the method of Yabuuchi et al. [Yabuuchi K. et al., Biogenic Amines, 18, 319-328 (2004)]. 50 ul of [3H] 8-OH-DPAT (final concentration: 0.5 nM), 1 ul of a test drug solution, and 149 ul of the h-5-HT1A/CHO membrane preparation (25 ug/well in terms of the amount of the protein) were added into a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH=7.4) and 4 mM CaCl2, and 200 ul in total of the reaction solution was used in the assay. The reaction solution was reacted at room temperature for 30 minutes and then immediately suction-filtered at a low pressure using a glass fiber filter paper. The glass fiber filter paper was washed twice with 250 ul of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH=7.4) and then added to a counting vial containing 4 ml of ACS-II (manufactured by GE Healthcare (formerly Amersham Biosciences)). Receptor binding-derived radioactivity remaining on the filter paper was measured using a liquid scintillation counter.

Cells were washed 3x with 200 ul assay medium (DMEM-F12 and 25 mM HEPES pH=7.4) and pre-incubated with assay medium containing 30 uM rolipram and test compounds at 37 C. for 15 min. 1 uM NECA was incubated for 15 min at 37 C. (total incubation time 30 min). Reaction was stopped with lysis buffer supplied in the kit and the enzymeimmunoassay was carried out for detection of intracellular cAMP at 450 nm in an Ultra Evolution detector (Tecan).

The radioligand binding assay was performed at room temperature in binding buffer (10 mM HEPES/KOH pH 7.4, mM MnCl2, with protease inhibitor cocktail tablets), containing 1.5 nM [3H]PGD2 (Amersham, 156 Cie/mmol), and 10 ug of hCRTH2 HEK293 (EBNA) cell membrane protein in a final volume of 100 ul in 96 well plates (Corning, USA). Non-specific binding was determined in the presence of 1 uM PGD2 (Cayman, USA). Competing pyrazine sulfonamides were diluted in dimethylsulphoxide so that the total volume of dimethylsulfoxide was kept constant at 1% dimethylsulphoxide (Me2SO). 10 ul of the pyrazine sulfonamides were added. Incubation (60 min at room temperature) was terminated by rapid filtration through 96 wells hydrophobic GF/C Unifilter plates.
Receptor Binding Assay: Receptor binding assay: Membranes were prepared from CHO cells expressing S1P1 or S1P3 for use in ligand and 355-GTPgammaS binding studies. Cells were suspended in 50 mM TRIS, pH 7.4, 2 mM EDTA, 250 mM Sucrose (buffer A) and 1x Complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), and disrupted at 4 C. by N2 decompression using a cell disruption bomb (Parr Instrument). Following centrifugation at 1000 RPM for 10 min at 4 C., the supernatant was suspended in buffer A and centrifuged again at 19000 RPM for 60 min at 4 C. The pellet was then suspended in 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 250 mM Sucrose (Buffer B), and 1x Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail and homogenized using a potter. Membranes were flash frozen in liquid N2 and stored at --80 C. [33P]sphingosine 1-phosphate (3000 Ci/mmol; American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc.) was added to test compounds in DMSO. Membranes and WGA SPA beads (GE Healthcare) were added to give a final volume of 100 ul in 96-well plates.
Receptor Binding Assay: The affinity of the compounds described herein was determined by competition binding assays similar to those described in Ryman-Rasmussen et al., Differential activation of adenylate cyclase and receptor internalization by novel dopamine D1 receptor agonists, Molecular Pharmacology 68(4):1039-1048 (2005). This radioligand binding assay used [3H]-SCH23390, a radiolabeled D1 ligand, to evaluate the ability of a test compound to compete with the radioligand when binding to a D1 receptor. D1 binding assays were performed using over-expressing LTK human cell lines. To determine basic assay parameters, ligand concentrations were determined from saturation binding studies where the Kd for [3H]-SCH23390 was found to be 1.3 nM. From tissue concentration curve studies, the optimal amount of tissue was determined to be 1.75 mg/mL per 96 well plate using 0.5 nM of [3H]-SCH23390. These ligand and tissue concentrations were used in time course studies to determine linearity and equilibrium condition.
Binding Inhibition Assay: A solution of the compound to be tested and 100 μM 5-CT (5-carboxamidetriptamine) in DMSO was added to a 96-well plate at 2 μl/well, suspended in an incubation buffer, and a membrane from HEK293 cells for forced expressions of a human 5-HT5A receptor prepared at 200 ug/ml was added at 100 μl/well. After incubation at room temperature for 15 minutes, a [3H]5-CT solution (2 nM [3H]5-CT, incubation buffer) was added thereto at 100 μl/well.Separately, 100 μl of the solution was distributed into a liquid scintillation vial, and 2 ml of Aquasol II (registered trademark) was added thereto, followed by stirring. Then, radioactivity was measured by a liquid scintillation counter. It was incubated at 37C. for 60 minutes. The reaction mixture was sucked into 96-well GF/C filter plate that had been pre-treated with 0.2% polyethyleneimine, and washed six times with an ice-cooled, 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5) buffer. The GF/C filter plate was dried.
Radioligand Binding Assay: HEK293 cells stably expressing human CB2 receptors were grown until a confluent monolayer was formed. Briefly, the cells were harvested and homogenized in TE buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM EDTA) using a polytron for 2x 10 second bursts in the presence of protease inhibitors, followed by centrifugation at 45,000xg for 20 minutes. The final membrane pellet was re-homogenized in storage buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM EDTA and 10% sucrose) and frozen at -78 C. until used. Saturation binding reactions were initiated by the addition of membrane preparation (protein concentration of 5 ug/well for human CB2) into wells of a deep well plate containing [3H]CP 55,940 (120 Ci/mmol, a nonselective CB agonist commercially available from Tocris) in assay buffer (50 mM Tris, 2.5 mM EDTA, 5 mM MgCl2, and 0.5 mg/mL fatty acid free BSA, pH 7.4). After 90 min incubation at 30 C., binding reaction was terminated by the addition of 300 uL/well of cold assay buffer.
In Vitro Assay: Receptor binding assay: Membranes were prepared from CHO cells expressing S1P1 or S1P3 for use in ligand and 35S-GTPgammaS binding studies. Cells were suspended in 50 mM TRIS, pH 7.4, 2 mM EDTA, 250 mM Sucrose (buffer A) and 1x Complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), and disrupted at 4 C. by nitrogen decompression using a cell disruption bomb (Parr Instrument). Following centrifugation at 1000 RPM for 10 min at 4 C, the supernatant was suspended in buffer A and centrifuged again at 19000 RPM for 60 min at 4 C. The pellet was then suspended in 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 250 mM Sucrose (Buffer B), and 1x Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail and homogenized using a potter. Membranes were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 C. [33P]sphingosine 1-phosphate (3000 Ci/mmol; American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc.) was added to test compounds in DMSO. Membranes and WGA SPA beads (GE Healthcare) were added to give a final volume of 100 ul in 96-well plates.
Radioligand Binding Assay: Radioligand binding assays were performed in CHO cells expressing human CCR2B and GalphaÂ±16 coupling protein. All compounds were dissolved in DMSO and assays run at a final DMSO concentration of 0.5% (v/v). [125I]-labeled human MCP-1 was purchased from PerkinElmer. Unlabelled human MCP-1 was purchased from PeproTech.Compounds were serially diluted in DMSO before diluting into assay buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, 0.5% BSA) with cryo preserved CHO cells expressing human CCR2B and the GalphaÂ±16 coupling protein (30x103/well) and [125I]-MCP-1 (50 pM). The reaction was incubated at room temperature for 90 minutes before transferring to GF/C filter membrane (PerkinElmer) pre-treated with 0.3% polyethyleneimine for 2 hours at 4 C. The filter membrane was washed six times with ice cold wash buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, 500 mM NaCl, 0.01% (m/v) azide), dried, and sealed in a RLB sample bag (Agilent Technologies).
Binding Assay: For binding, Bradykinin-1 receptor antagonist compounds were added in various concentrations in 50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl2 together with 6 nM Kallidin (Des Arg10, Leu9), [3,4-Prolyl-3,4-3H(N)] (PerkinElmer, 1.85-4.44 TBq/mmol) to 40 μg membrane protein containing approximately 1 fmol Bradykinin-1 receptor and incubated for 15 min at 27° C. To determine non-specific binding 10 μM Lys-(Des-Arg9)-Bradykinin (Bachem) was added. Membranes were harvested through GF/B (glass fiber filter; PerkinElmer) plates, equilibrated with 0.5% polyethylenimine, air dried at 50° C. for 2 hr. Radioactivity was determined by counting in a topcounter (NXT Packard). Specific binding was defined as total binding minus nonspecific binding and typically represents about 90-95% of the total binding. Antagonist activity is expressed as Ki: inhibitor concentration required for 50% inhibition of specific binding corrected for the concentration of the radioligand.
Binding Assay: The ability of test compounds to displace 3H-raclopride at the D2s receptor can be determined on membranes from D2s-transfected CHO cells (Bmax 13 pmol/mg protein). An assay can use a standard 96-well glass-fiber filter plate to retain radioligand bound by the receptor. Retained 3H can be determined in a TopCount scintillation plate counter following the addition of a liquid scintillant to each well. Compounds can be evaluated for their potency using competition curve analysis, resulting in calculated Ki values.
Radioligand Binding Assay: Binding assays were performed as described in [J. A. O'Brien et al. Mol. Pharmacol., 2003, 64, 731-740] with slight modifications, including that a radioligand that binds to the methyl-5-(2-pyridinylethynyl)pyridine (MPEP) binding site was used in place of [3H]-MPEP. Briefly, after thawing, the membrane homogenates were resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl and 0.9% NaCl binding buffer at pH 7.4 to a final assay concentration of 20 ug is protein/well for radioligand filtration binding. Incubations included 5 nM radioligand, membranes and either buffer or varying concentrations of compound. Samples were incubated for 60 min at room temperature with shaking. Non-specific binding was defined with 10 uM cold MPEP when using the radioligand. After incubation, samples were filtered over a GF/C filter (presoaked in 0.25% polyethyleneimine (PEI)) and then washed 4 times using a Tomtec Harvester 96 Mach III cell harvester (Tomtec, Hamden, Conn.) with 0.5 mL ice-cold 50 mM Tris-HCl.
Radioligand Binding Assay: HEK293 stably expressing human orexin 2 receptor (Genebank accession number NM 001526) were grown to confluency in DMEM (Hyclone, cat # SH30022), 10% FBS, 1x Pen/Strep, 1x NaPyruvate, 10 mM HEPES, 600 ug/ml G418 media on 150 cm2 tissue culture plates, washed with 5 mM EDTA in PBS (HyClone Dulbecco's Phosphate Buffered Saline 1x with Calcium and Magnesium, Cat # SH30264.01, hereafter referred to simply as PBS) and scraped into 50 ml tubes. After centrifugation (2Kx G, 5 min at 4x C.), the supernatant was aspirated and the pellets frozen and stored at -80 C. Cells were resuspended in PBS in the presence of 1 tablet of protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Cat. #11836145001) per 50 mL. Each cell pellet from a 15 cm plate was resuspended in 10 mL, stored on ice, and homogenized for 45 sec just prior to addition to the reactions. Competition binding experiments in 96 well polypropylene plates were performed using [3H]-EMPA (Moraveck Corporation, specific activity=29.6 Ci/mmol).

Reactions were carried out in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled naloxone. All reactions were conducted in 96-deep well polypropylene plates for 2 hr at room temperature. Binding reactions were terminated by rapid filtration onto 96-well Unifilter GF/C filter plates (Perkin Elmer, Shelton, Conn.), presoaked in 0.5% polyethylenimine using a 96-well tissue harvester (Perkin Elmer, Shelton, Conn.) followed by performing three filtration washes with 500 ul of ice-cold binding buffer. Filter plates were subsequently dried at 50 C. for 2-3 hours. BetaScint scintillation cocktail (Perkin Elmer, Shelton, Conn.) was added (50 ul/well).
Binding Assay: Kippa-Opioid Receptor Binding Assay Procedures: Membranes from recombinant HEK-293 cells expressing the human kippa opioid receptor (kippa) (cloned in house) were prepared by lysing cells in ice cold hypotonic buffer (2.5 mM MgCl2, 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) (10 mL/10 cm dish) followed by homogenization with a tissue grinder/Teflon pestle. Membranes were collected by centrifugation at 30,000xg for 15 mM at 4 C. and pellets were resuspended in hypotonic buffer to a final concentration of 1-3 mg/mL. Protein concentrations were determined using the BioRad protein assay reagent with bovine serum albumen as standard. Aliquots of kippa receptor membranes were stored at -80 C.Radioligand dose displacement assays used 0.4 nM [3H]-U69,593 (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, N.J.; 40 Ci/mmole) with 15 ug membrane protein (recombinant lc opioid receptor expressed in HEK 293 cells; in-house prep) in a final volume of 200 ul binding buffer (5% DMSO, 50 mM Trizma base, pH 7.4).

Filter plates were subsequently dried at 50 C. for 1-2 hours.
Binding Assay: Transfected HEK 293(ebna) cells are maintained in culture, harvested and membranes are prepared by differential centrifugation, following lysis of the cells in the presence of protease inhibitors, for use in receptor binding assays. Prostanoid receptor binding assays (for DPI, DP2 (CRTH2), EPl, EP2, EP3-III, EP4, FP, IP, and TP) are performed in 10 mM MES/KOH (pH 6.0) (EPs, FP and TP) or 10 mM HEPES/KOH (pH 7.4) (DPs and IP), containing 1 mM EDTA, 2.5-30 mM divalent cation and the appropriate radioligand. Synthetic compounds are added in dimethylsulfoxide which is kept constant at 1 % (v/v) in all incubations. The reaction is initiated by addition of membrane protein. Non-specific binding is determined in the presence of 10 uM of the corresponding non-radioactive prostanoid . Incubations are conducted for 60-90 min at room temperature or 30 0C and terminated by rapid filtration. Specific binding is calculated by subtracting non specific binding from total binding.
Radioligand Binding Assay: The affinity of a test compound for the human dopamine receptor subtype hDRD2 was determined by radioligand binding assays in CHO-K1 cells stably transfected with hDRD2 receptor, as follows. The cDNA coding sequence of hDRD2 (GenBank accession No. X51362) was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1/GS (Life Technologies). Clonal cell lines stably expressing hDRD2 were obtained by transfection into CHO-K1 cells and subsequently selected with culture medium containing 0.3 mg/mL of zeocin (Life Technologies).Membranes for in vitro receptor binding assays were obtained by the following procedures. CHO-K1 cells expressing hDRD2 were homogenized in ice-cold buffer with 10 mM Tris-HCl, 5 mM EDTA, 3 mM EGTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsuphonyl fluoride, pH 7.6 using Polytron PT10-35GT (Kinematica) at 18,000 rpm for 30 seconds and centrifuged at 500xg for 10 minutes. The supernatant containing the plasma membranes was centrifuged at 100,000xg for 30 minutes and the pellet was resuspended.
Binding Assay: A test compound and 150 uM of a DMSO solution of 5-carboxamide tryptamine (5-CT) were added to a 96-well plate at 2 ul/well and suspended in the incubation buffer, and the HEK293 cells forced to express the human 5-HT5A receptor that were prepared at a concentration of 200 ug/ml were added thereto at 100 ul/well. The cells were incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature, and then a [3H]5-CT solution (3 nM [3H]5-CT, incubation buffer) was added thereto at 100 ul/well.100 ul of the cell solution was separately dispensed into a liquid scintillation vial, and 2 ml of Aquasol II (registered trademark) was added thereto, followed by stirring. Thereafter, the radioactivity thereof was measured using a liquid scintillation counter. The cells were incubated for 60 minutes at 37 C. The reaction mixture was aspirated into a 96-well GF/C filter plate having undergone pretreatment with 0.2% polyethyleneimine, and washed 6 times with an ice-cold 50 mM Tris (pH 7.4).
Binding Assay: Evaluation of the affinity of compounds for the human MCH-1 receptor was accomplished using 4-(3,4,5-tritritiumbenzyloxy)-1-(1-(2-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)ethyl)-1H-indazol-5-yl)pyridin-2(1H)-one and membranes prepared from stable CHO-K1 cells expressing the human MCH-1 receptor obtained from Euroscreen (Batch 1138). Cell membrane homogenates (8.92 μg protein) were incubated for 60 min at 25° C. with 1.4 μM of the [3H]-labeled compound in the absence or presence of the test compound in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 50 μM 1-(5-(4-cyanophenyl)bicyclo[3.1.0]hexan-2-yl)-3-(4-fluoro-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-1-(3-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)propyl)urea.

FRET-Based Binding Assay: Assay protocol: Compounds were evaluated on an in-vitro binding assay developed based on the technology described in the patent WO 98/55873. This assay was developed from hA2A receptor that was fused at its amino terminal domain to Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) and stably expressed in HEK cells. The probe used is a dyed ligand derived from the non-selective CGS15943. For the FRET-binding experiment, HEK GFP-A2A stable cell line was seeded onto poly-D-lysine precoated black-walled 96-well plates in normal growth media (0.7 105 cells per well). After 24 hours of culture at 37Â° C., the cell media was removed and cells were washed. The tested compounds were applied on cells by the FLIPRTETRAÂ® (Molecular DevicesÂ®) and incubated for 10 minutes prior to addition of the dyed probe. When a drug interacts with the receptor, the FRET signal measured by the variation of GFP fluorescence at 510 nm is disrupted. The time curves of ligand binding were recorded during 1000 seconds.

This radioligand binding assay used [3H]-SCH23390, a radiolabeled D1 ligand, to evaluate the ability of a test compound to compete with the radioligand when binding to a D1 receptor.D1 binding assays were performed using over-expressing LTK human cell lines. To determine basic assay parameters, ligand concentrations were determined from saturation binding studies where the Kd for [3H]-SCH23390 was found to be 1.3 nM. From tissue concentration curve studies, the optimal amount of tissue was determined to be 1.75 mg/mL per 96 well plate using 0.5 nM of [3H]-SCH23390. These ligand and tissue concentrations were used in time course studies to determine linearity and equilibrium.
Radioligand Binding Assay: A bivalent ligand 1 (FIG. 14) that combines the pharmacophores of naltrexone (a MOR antagonist) and maraviroc (a CCR5 antagonist) into one molecule was designed and synthesized. Herein is reported the characterization of this novel molecular probe in for its binding affinity, Ca2− flux functional activity, and HIV-1 inhibition potency. Bivalent ligand 1 was first characterized in hMOR-expressed CHO cells in the competitive radioligand binding assay as described previously.
Radioligand Binding Assay: Afterwards, the pharmacological profile of bivalent ligand 1 at the chemokine receptor CCR5 was characterized similarly. The competitive radioligand binding assay was conducted in CCR5 rhesus macaque membrane preparations from Chem-1 cells. Monovalent ligand 3 and compound 4, an analogue of maraviroc, were tested along under the same condition. Introduction of the 4-NH2 group onto the phenyl ring of maraviroc, as seen in compound 4, caused approximately 65-fold decrease in the binding affinity, compared to maraviroc. The decrease of the binding affinity was even more profound for bivalent ligand 1 and monovalent ligand 3, as their Ki values dropped to submicromolar range, respectively.

Each filtermat in a heat-sealed bag, is counted in a Wallac 1450 MicroBeta Liquid Scintillation and Luminescence Counter.
Beta1-AR Binding Assay: Beta1-AR binding was done on rat cortical membrane following a previously described procedure (Beer et al., Biochem. Pharmacol. 37: 1145-1151, 1988). In brief, male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 250-350 g were decapitated and their brains quickly removed. The cerebral cortices were dissected on ice, weighed and promptly transferred to a 50 ml test tube containing approximately 30 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8 (at room temperature). The tissues were homogenized with a polytron and centrifuged at 20,000xg for 12 min at 4° C. The pellet was washed again in the same manner and resuspended at a concentration of 20 mg (original wet wt) per 1 ml in the assay buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM ascorbic acid at pH 7.8). To block the beta2 sites present in the cortical membrane preparation, 30 nM ICI 118-551 was also added to the assay buffer. To wells containing 100 ul of the test drug and 100 ul of [3H]CGP-12177 (1.4 nM final concentration), 0.8 ml of tissue homogenate was added. After 2 hours at 25° C., the incubation was terminated by rapid filtration. Nonspecific binding was determined by 10 uM propranolol.
Scintillation Proximity Assay (SPA): Briefly, serial dilutions of the test compounds were placed in a 96-well plate to which were added SPA beads, membrane and radioligand. The assay conditions for each opioid receptor subtype are described in Table 10 below. The plates were incubated for 8 hours-overnight at room temperature, spun at 1000 rpm to pellet the SPA beads, and radioactivity was measured using the TopCount microplate Scintillation counter. Specific binding at each concentration of test compound was calculated by subtracting the non-specific binding measured in the presence of excess cold ligand. IC50 values were obtained by non-linear regression of specific binding versus concentration curves and Ki values were calculated using Kd values that were experimentally pre-determined for each lot of membrane preparations.
Binding of PEG-Nalbuphine assays: Specific binding is determined by subtraction of the cpm bound in the presence of 50-100× excess of cold ligand. Binding data assays were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 4.0 and IC50 is generated by non-linear regression from dose-response curves. Ki values were calculated using the Cheng Prusoff equation using the Kd values from saturation isotherms as follows: Ki=IC50/(1+[Ligand]/Kd).
Radioligand Binding Assay: Radioligand binding was performed using filtration or scintillation proximity assay (SPA) technology. SPA assays were done at room temperature in 10 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA containing 2 mM MnCl2 and 16 nM [3H]-PGD2 (PerkinElmer, Waltham, Mass.) (164 Ci mmol-1), in a final volume of 0.05 mL. Competing ligands were diluted in dimethylsulfoxide and added using very low volumes (500 nL). The reaction was initiated by the addition of a mixture of 3.52 ug of membrane protein prepared from a human embryonic kidney (HEK)-hCRTH2 cell line adhered to 140 ug of wheatgerm agglutinin SPA beads (PerkinElmer). Total and non-specific binding were determined in the absence and the presence of a CRTH2 antagonist, respectively. The reaction was routinely conducted for 60 minutes at room temperature followed by centrifugation for 5 minutes at 1000 RPM. The radioactivity was measured with a TopCountNXT (PerkinElmer). Filtration binding assays were done in a similar way with minor differences. The assay volume was 0.20 mL and competing ligands in dimethylsulfoxide were added in 2 uL. [3H]-PGD2 was used at 0.6 nM, and reactions were initiated by the addition of 10 ug of membrane protein. Reactions were terminated by filtration through GF/C filter plates (PerkinElmer) presoaked in 10 mM HEPES. After washing with buffer, plates were dried in a 50° C. oven for 1 h, scintillation cocktail was added and radioactivity was measured. Results determined using the SPA-based assay were similar to those from the filtration binding assay.

Duplicated tubes were incubated at 30° C. for 50 mins (for D1, and D2) with increasing concentrations of respective compound and with [3H]SCH23390 (for D1 dopamine receptors), or [3H]Spiperone (for dopamine D2 receptor) in a final volume of 200 μL binding buffer containing 50 mM Tris, 4 mM MgCl2, pH 7.4. Nonspecific binding was determined by parallel incubations with either 10 μM SCH23390 for D1, or Spiperone for D2 receptors respectively. The reaction was started by addition of membranes (15 ng/tube) and stopped by rapid filtration through Whatman GF/B glassfiber filter and subsequently washed with cold buffer (50 mM Tris, 5 mM EDTA, pH 7.4) using a Brandel 24-well cell harvester. Scintillation cocktail was added and the radioactivity was determined in a MicroBeta liquid scintillation counter.
Competition Binding Assay: The Kd of CP 55,940 in the isolated CB1 and CB2 receptor expressing membranes was previously determined to be 2.3 nM and 1.5 nM, respectively (see Pertwee, R. G. Current Medicinal Chemistry 6 635-664 (1999)). Competition binding assays at 2.5 nM [3H]-CP 55,940 (PerkinElmer) were carried out to determine the K1 values for tested compounds. Membranes (5-10 μg) were incubated with radioligand and a range of concentrations of test compounds in binding buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA) with 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) (ICP Bio, New Zealand), at 30° C. for 60 min.

Reactions were carried out in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled naloxone. All reactions were conducted in 96-deep well polypropylene plates for 2 hours at room temperature. Binding reactions were terminated by rapid filtration onto 96-well Unifilter GF/C filter plates (Perkin Elmer, Shelton, Conn.), presoaked in 0.5% polyethylenimine using a 96-well tissue harvester (Perkin Elmer, Shelton, Conn.) followed by performing three filtration washes with 500 μl of ice-cold binding buffer.

Radioligand Binding Assay: Displacement assays for determination of Ki values of test compounds were performed with [3H]-NMS at 1 nM and eleven different test compound concentrations. The test compounds were initially dissolved to a concentration of 400 μM in dilution buffer and then serially diluted 5× with dilution buffer to final concentrations ranging from 10 pM to 100 μM. The order of addition and volumes added to the assay plates were as follows: 25 μL radioligand, 25 μL diluted test compound, and 50 μL membranes. Assay plates were incubated for 6 hours at 37° C. Binding reactions were terminated by rapid filtration over GF/B glass fiber filter plates (PerkinElmer, Inc.) pre-treated in 1% BSA. Filter plates were rinsed three times with wash buffer (10 mM HEPES) to remove unbound radioactivity. The plates were then air-dried and 50 μL Microscint-20 liquid scintillation fluid (PerkinElmer, Inc.) were added to each well. The plates were then counted in a PerkinElmer Topcount liquid scintillation counter (PerkinElmer, Inc.).
Functional Assay: A functional assay screen for the inhibition of adenylate cyclase (AC) activity was chosen as the subsequent assay. This screen would allow us to gain a better understanding of the intrinsic activity of the analogues that displayed moderate to high sub-micromolar affinity for the CBRs. Reaching full-receptor occupancy, which is predicted to produce maximal efficacy, is desirable at 10 μM concentration of all the compounds was used. The non-selective CB1R/CB2R full agonist CP-55,940 was used as a positive control and it produced 45% AC-inhibition at CB1Rs endogenously expressed in Neuro2A cells (FIG. 19A) and 37% AC-inhibition in CHO cell transfected with hCB2 receptors (FIG. 19B). Most compounds tested exhibit AC-inhibition similar to that produced by the full agonist CP-55,940. TV-5-129, TV-6-249, and TV-6-41, however, produce lower AC-inhibition at CB1Rs than the full agonist CP-55,940 with −4, 18, and 16% inhibition, respectively (FIG. 19A). Despite little or no AC-inhibition observed at CB1Rs, these compounds behaved differently at CB2Rs. Specifically, the three compounds in question exhibited AC-inhibition that was in the range of the inhibition seen with CP-55,940 and were shown to inhibit adenylate cyclase with 22.1, 33.2, and 20.8%, respectively (FIG. 19B).
Binding Assay: The compounds were examined with membranes of recombinant CHO-ORL 1 cells in a receptor binding assay with 3H-nociceptin/orphanin FQ. This test system was conducted in accordance with the method outlined by Ardati et al. (Mol. Pharmacol., 51, 1997, pp. 816-824). The concentration of 3H-nociceptin/orphanin FQ amounted to 0.5 nM in these tests. The binding assays were conducted in each case on 20 ug of membrane protein per 200ul of preparation in 50 mM of HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 nM of MgCl2 and 1 mM of EDTA. The binding to the ORL 1-receptor was determined using 1 mg of WGA-SPA beads (Amersham-Pharmacia, Freiburg) in each case by incubating the preparation for one hour at RT and then conducting measurements in the Trilux scintillation counter (Wallac, Finland).

Membranes were diluted in assay buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mg/ml BSA, pH=7.4). The amount of membrane was determined for each batch of membranes according to protein binding assay. The minimum amount of membrane that gave 50% specific binding was used for the binding assay. In most assays, binding was tested using 8 μg and 4 μg protein of hCB1 and hCB2 membranes, respectively. The tested compounds were dissolved in DMSO and diluted in assay buffer to a final concentration of 0.1% solvent. Total binding of [3H]CP55940 was evaluated with 1.5 nM to hCB1 and with 0.5 nM to hCB2, according to Kd affinity of [3H]CP55940 for the respective membranes. The ability of the tested compounds to displace [3H]CP55940 was evaluated first at a single concentration point of 100 nM for binding toward hCB2 or hCB1. In certain cases, the displacement was tested at compound concentrations ranging from 0.03 nM to 10 μM. Non-specific binding was measured by the addition of 1 μM of unlabelled CP55940 to the tubes. Binding assays were performed in triplicate in a total volume of 500 μl for 60 minutes at 30° C., in a shaking bath. Free and bound radioligands were separated by rapid filtration through GF/C filter plates (PerkinElmer) that had been presoaked with 0.1% Polyethylenimine (Sigma). Filters were shaken for 1 hour in 7 ml scintillation fluid (PerkinElmer) and radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counter (Wallac; PerkinElmer).

In Vitro Assay: The in vitro affinity of the compounds of the present invention for the CXCR1 and CXCR2 receptors was determined on a functional test of the .beta.-arrestin recruitment type after receptor activation.It was demonstrated that the activation by CXCL8 of the CXCR2 receptor in cells of the PathHunter HEK293-CXCR2 line or of the CXCR1 receptor in cells of the U2OS h CXCR1 .beta.-arrestin line results in the recruitment of .beta.-arrestin (Richardson et al. 2003 Role of the cytoplasmic tails of CXCR1 and CXCR2 in mediating leukocyte migration, activation, and regulation. J. Immunol. 170: 2904-2911.)In order to evaluate the direct interaction of the CXCR2 or CXCR1 receptor with .beta.-arrestin 2, a .beta.-arrestin 2 recruitment test for CXCR2 or CXCR1 based on of .beta.-galactosidase enzyme complementation (Olson K R, Eglen R M.

Human NK1 Receptor Binding Assay: IM-9 cells (2×10^5 cells/mL) were cultured for 3 days after inoculation, and centrifuged at 500×g for 10 min to give cell pellets. The obtained pellets were washed with PBS (Phosphate-Buffered saline) (GIBCO), disrupted in buffer A (50 mM Tris-hydrochloric acid buffer (Tris-HCl) (pH 7.4) containing 120 mM sodium chloride, 5 mM potassium chloride, 2 μg/mL chymostatin, 40 μg/mL bacitracin, 40 μg/mL APMSF (p-amidinophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride) and 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)) using a Polytron homogenizer (Kinematika, Germany), and centrifuged at 100,000×g for 40 min. The precipitation fraction was suspended in buffer B (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.02% bovine serum albumin, 2 μg/mL chymostatin, 40 μg/mL bacitracin, 40 μg/mL APMSF, 3 mM manganese dichloride (MnCl2)) and cryopreserved (−80° C.) as a receptor reference standard. Buffer B (50 μL) was added to a 96-well microassay plate (Corning Incorporated). The membrane reference standard suspended in buffer B at 250 μg/mL was added by 50 μL. A measurement buffer containing 2% dimethyl sulfoxide was added by 50 μL to examine the total binding, 4 μM non-labeled SP diluted with a measurement buffer containing 2% dimethyl sulfoxide was added by 50 μL to examine the non-specific binding, and a test compound diluted with a measurement buffer (containing 2% dimethyl sulfoxide) was added by 50 μL to examine the binding inhibitory activity of the test compound. Furthermore, 400 μM 125I-Bolton-Hunter-SP (BH-SP) solution was added to each well by 50 μL. After reaction at room temperature for 30 min, the reaction was quenched using a cell harvester (PerkinElmer) by rapid filtration on a GF/C filter plate (PerkinElmer), and the cells were washed 10 times with 250 μL of a 50 mM Tris-hydrochloric acid buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.02% bovine serum albumin. The GF/C filter plate was dried, MicroScinti-0 (PerkinElmer) was added by 20 μL, and the radioactivity was measured on a TopCount (PerkinElmer). The GF/C filter plate was immersed in 0.3% polyethyleneimine for one day before use.
Radioligand Binding Assay: Plasma membranes prepared from HEK 293 EBNA cells transfected with human CB1 or CB2 cannabinoid receptors (3.7 or 3.3 .mu.mol/mg protein, receptor concentration; PerkinElmer) were used for the radioligand binding studies. The composition of incubation buffer for CB1 assay was 50 mM Tris base, 2.5 mM EDTA, 5 mM MgCl.sub.2 and 0.5 mg/ml fatty acid free BSA and for CB2 assay was 50 mM Tris base, 2.5 mM EGTA, 5 mM MgCl.sub.2 and 1 mg/ml fatty acid free BSA; pH was adjusted to 7.4 by adding 1N HCl. Plasma membranes were diluted with incubation buffer to provide a final protein concentration of 2.4 .mu.g (CB1) or 8 .mu.g (CB2) per well in non-binding surface polystyrene 96-well assay plates (Corning). Compound solutions were prepared in silanized glass tubes and dispensed using pipette tips with SUPERSLIK.TM. surface.

Binding Assay: Radioligand receptor binding inhibitory assay using human NK receptor.
TR-FRET-Based Phosphodiesterase Assay: A TR-FRET-based phosphodiesterase assay kit from "Molecular Devices" was used to test whether these compounds were indeed direct inhibitors of the PDE4 enzyme. Using Roflumilast as a positive control, compounds of the present invention were tested against fluorescein-labeled cAMP substrate. The principle of the assay is based on the binding of a nucleotide monophosphate generated upon cAMP conversion to 5′ AMP by PDE to an "IMAP binding reagent", which in turn is also ligated to a separate complex carrying terbium (Tb)-donor molecule. Proximity of the fluoreceinated 5′AMP to the Tb donor generates Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer. A PDE inhibitor will reduce the conversion of cAMP to 5′AMP, thus reducing monophosphate that can bind to the IMAP binding reagent and reduce the resulting FRET signal.
Cell Based Assay: mGluR5 activity was determined in a cell-based assay.
Fluorescence-Based Assay: Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells overexpressing the human S1P2 gene were cultured in a Ham's F12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), an antibiotic/antifungal agent and G418. CHO cells overexpressing the rat S1P2 gene were cultured in a Ham's F12 medium containing 10% FBS, penicillin/streptomycin and blasticidin S. The cultured cells were incubated in a Fura2-AM solution (5 uM) [a Ham's F12 medium containing FBS (10%), HEPES buffer (20 mM, pH 7.2 to 7.5) and probenecid (2.5 mM)] at 37 C. for 60 minutes. The cells were washed twice with a Hanks' balanced saline containing HEPES buffer (20 mM, pH 7.2 to 7.5) and probenecid (2.5 mM) and immersed in the same solution. A plate was mounted on a fluorescence-based drug screening system and the intracellular calcium ion concentration was measured for 30 seconds without stimulation.
Enzyme Assay: The 11-β-HSD-1 enzyme assay was carried out in 96 well microtiter plates in a total volume of 100 μl containing 30 mM Hepes buffer, pH 7.4 with 1 mM EDTA, substrate mixture cortisone/NADPH (200 nM/200 μM), G-6-P (1 mM) and inhibitors in serial dilutions. Reactions were initiated by addition of 10 μl 11-β-HSD-1 (3 μg) from E. coli, either as microsome fractions from rat and mice liver (2.5 μg). Following mixing, the plates were shaken for 150 minutes at 37° C. The reactions were terminated with 10 μl Acid-18beta glycyrrhetinic stop solution. Determinations of cortisol levels in 11-β-HSD-1 preparations were monitored by HTRF (HTRF cortisol assay from Cis bio international).
Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor Activity Assay: The utility of the compounds in accordance with the present invention as negative allosteric modulators of metabotropic glutamate receptor activity, in particular mGluR5 activity, can be demonstrated by methodology known in the art. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells transfected with rat or human mGluR5 were plated in clear bottom assay plates for assay in a Functional Drug Screening System (FDSS). The cells were loaded with a Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent dye (e.g., Fluo-4), and the plates were washed and placed in the FDSS instrument. Test compound was applied to cells 3 seconds after baseline readings were taken. Cells were incubated with the test compounds for 140 seconds and then stimulated with an EC20 concentration of an mGluR5 agonist (e.g., glutamate, 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine, or quisqualate); 60-80 seconds later an EC80 concentration of agonist was added and readings taken for an additional 40 seconds. Data were collected at 1 Hz. Negative allosteric modulation of the agonist.
Binding Assay: Receptor binding assays were performed using crude membranes prepared from CHO cells expressing human NK3 receptor. Osanetant (SR142801), a non-peptide NK3 antagonist, was used as a ligand, and SB222200 was used as a positive control reference compound. The assay was performed with cell membrane homogenates (24 ug protein) incubated for 120 min at 22 C. with 0.4 nM [3H]SR142801 in the absence or presence of the test compound in a buffer containing 20 mM Hepes/NaOH (pH 7.4), 120 mM NaCl, 1 mM MnCl2, 0.01% bacitracin, 0.002% aprotinin and 0.1% BSA. Following incubation, the samples were filtered rapidly under vacuum through glass fiber filters (GF/B, Packard) that had been presoaked with 0.3% PEI. The filters were rinsed several times with ice-cold 50 mM Tris/HCl using a 96-sample cell harvester (Unifilter, Packard), dried, and counted for radioactivity in a scintillation counter (Topcount, Packard) using a scintillation cocktail (Microscint 0, Packard).

In this competitive binding assay, the test compound competed against a radiolabeled agonist for binding to the P2Y12 receptor, expressed on the cell membrane. Inhibition of binding of the labeled material was measured and correlated to the amount and potency of the test compound.

Assay incubations were performed for 60 mM at room temperature and were terminated by rapid filtration under vacuum pressure of the reaction mixture over Whatman GF/C glass fiber filters presoaked in 0.5% PEI using a Brandell cell harvester.
Activation Assay: Melanin Concentrating Hormone Receptor 1 (MCHR1) is a G-protein coupled receptor that interacts with heterotrimeric G proteins containing a Gαi/o subunit. Binding of MCH to MCHR1 results in the exchange of GDP for GTP on the Gαi/o proteins associated with the activated receptor. This activation can be quantified by measuring the amount of a GTP analog, GTPγ35S, bound to the membrane-associated receptor. GTPγ35S is not hydrolyzed by the intrinsic GTPase activity of a G-protein but instead forms a stable complex. Inhibition of MCH binding by a competing ligand may thus be assessed by a decrease in the amount of GTPγ35S bound to membranes in the presence of such a competing ligand.
Calcium Flux Assay: Calcium Flux Assay Using Fluorometric Imaging Plate Reader (FLIPR). Buffer containing dye (from the FLIPR® Calcium 3 Assay Kit from Molecular Devices, a division of MDS Analytical Technologies and MDS Inc.) was prepared by dissolving the contents of one bottle into 200 mL Hank's Balanced Salt Solution containing 20 mM HEPES (4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid) and 2.5 mM probenecid. Growth media was removed from the cell plates and 25 μL of Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) containing 20 mM HEPES, 0.05% BSA and 2.5 mM probenecid was added to each well followed by 25 μL of diluted dye using a Multidrop dispenser. The plates were then incubated for 1 hour at 37° C.
Biological Assays: Binding assay was performed in a final assay volume of 250 μl. First, 25 μl of test compound, previously diluted in Binding-Buffer (Binding-Buffer: 50 mM Tris-Base, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% BSA (protease free), 0.01% NaN3, 10 mM MnCl2 pH 7.0) was placed into each well. After addition of 75 μl Binding-Buffer, 50 μl of the radioligand 3H-PGD2 (at 2.5 nM (220.000 dpm/well) from ANAWA ART0662) was added to each well. Binding assay was started by addition of 100 μl CRTH2 membrane fragments, reaching a final concentration of 20 μg/well. For non-specific binding, PGD2 was added to the reaction mixture to 10 mM final concentration.
In Vitro mTOR Assay: The Invitrogen (Carlsbad, Calif.) mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) Lanthascreen assay can be used to quantitate mTOR kinase activity in an in vitro setting. Active mTOR phosphorylates eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) on residue threonine 46. This phosphorylation event can be detected with a phospho-specific terbium (Tb) labeled Ab, in turn bringing the Tb label in close proximity to the GFP tagged 4E-BP 1 and allowing for time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET), which correlates 4E-BP1 phosphorylation levels with mTOR kinase activity.
Radioligand Binding Assay: Radioligand binding studies were carried out with M3 receptor cell homogenates as described (Peralta et al., The EMBO Journal 6, 3923-3929, (1987)). Incubations of test ligands (or standard) with 0.2 nM [3H]4-DAMP were incubated for 120 minutes at 22 C. using human M3 receptor-expressing cell homogenates. Specific ligand binding to the receptors was defined as the difference between the total radioligand binding and the nonspecific binding determined in the presence of an excess of unlabelled ligand (10 atropine). The results were expressed as a percent of control specific binding ((measured specific binding/control specific binding)x100) obtained in the presence of various concentrations of the test compounds.
Radio Ligand Binding Assay: Serial dilutions of compounds (stock in 10 mM DMSO) are prepared by first diluting the compounds in DMSO followed by a 1:50 dilution into assay buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, 0.5% fatty acid-free BSA, 0.05% Tween-20). The radioligand [3H]4 (example 39) (specific activity 1500 GBq/mmol) is diluted directly into the assay buffer immediately before use to obtain a 20 nM solution. The desired amount of membranes (20 μg/well) is diluted with assay buffer. 50 μL of pre-diluted compound and 50 μL of [3H]4 (example 39) is placed into the bottom of a 96-well well plate. 100 μL of the membrane-suspension is added and the plate stirred for 60 minutes. The reaction is stopped by transfer onto the filter of a 96-well GF/C filter plate (soaked for 1 hour in 0.25% PEI) using a cell harvester.
Binding Assay: Methods for performing in vitro dopamine receptor binding studies are described in Huang et al. J. Med. Chem. 44:1815-1826 (2001) and Luedtke et al. Synapse 38:438-439 (2000). These papers describe radioactively labeled dopamine receptor selective ligands binding with picomolar affinity and nonselectivity to D2 and D3 dopamine receptors expressed in Sf9 and HEK 293 cells. 125I-IABN binds with 7- to 10-fold lower affinity to human D4.4 dopamine receptors expressed in HEK 293 cells. Dissociation constants (Kd) calculated from kinetic experiments were found to be in agreement with equilibrium Kd values obtained from saturation binding studies. Saturation plots of the binding of 125I-IABN with rat caudate membrane preparations were monophasic and exhibited low nonspecific binding.
Functional Assay: To measure D2 and D3 stimulation of mitogenesis (agonist assay) or D2 and D3 inhibition of quinpirole stimulation of mitogenesis (antagonist assay), CHOp-cells (human receptor) were seeded in a 96-well plate at a concentration of 5,000 cells/well. The cells were incubated at 37C. in alpha -MEM with 10% FBS, 0.05% penicillin-streptomycin, and 200 ug/mL of G418. After 48 hours, the cells were rinsed twice with serum-free alpha -MEM and incubated for 24 hours at 37 C. In the functional assay for agonism, the medium was removed and replaced with 90 ul of serum-free alpha -MEM and 10 ul of test compound in sterile water; in the antagonist assay, the test compound was diluted in sterile water plus 30 nM quinpirole. After another 24-hour incubation at 37 C., 0.25 uCi of [3H]thymidine was added to each well and the plates were further incubated for 2 hours at 37 C. The cells were then trypsinized, and the plates were filtered and counted as usual in the art.
Binding Scintillation Proximity Assay: The receptor-ligand binding Scintillation Proximity Assay (SPA) (N. D. Cook. Drug Discovery Today 1 (1996), pp. 287-294) for SSTR3 was performed with membranes isolated from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 cells stably expressing the cloned human somatostatin receptors. Binding assays were performed in 384 well format using 125I-SS14 as the radioligand for SSTR3. The assay buffer consisted of 50 mM TrisHCl (pH 7.8) with 1 mM EGTA, 5 mM MgCl2, leupeptin (10 μg/mL), pepstatin (10 μg/mL), bacitracin (200 μg/mL), and aprotinin (0.5 μg/mL). CHO-K1 cell membranes were prebound to SPA beads and incubated with unlabelled test compounds and radiolabeled somatostatin in assay buffer. After 5 hours at room temperature, cpm/well was determined. Test compounds were examined in 10 point titrations over a range of concentrations from 0.00001 nM to 1200 nM. Percent inhibition was determined for each data point using binding in the presence of DMSO as the maximum achievable value.
DELFIA Assay: This test uses active PTK2 enzyme (Invitrogen Code PV3832) and poly-Glu-Tyr (4:1, Sigma P-0275) as the kinase substrate. The kinase activity is detected by means of the phosphorylation of the substrate in a DELFIA assay. The phosphorylated substrate is detected with the Europium-labelled phosphotyrosine antibody PY20 (Perkin Elmer, No.: AD0038). In order to determine concentration-activity curves with PTK2-inhibitors the compounds are serially diluted in 10% DMSO/H2O and 10 L of each dilution are dispensed per well in a 96-well microtitre plate (clear U-shaped base plate, Greiner No. 650101) (the inhibitors are tested in duplicates) and mixed with 10 L/well of PTK2 kinase (0.01 ug/well). PTK2 kinase is diluted accordingly beforehand with kinase dilution buffer (20 mM TRIS/HCl pH 7.5, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM EGTA, 0.286 mM sodium orthovanadate, 10% glycerol with the addition of freshly prepared BSA (fraction V 1 mg/mL) and DTT (1 mM)).

The cells are plated in 384 well black plates (10'000 cells per well). After 24 hours the cells are loaded with Fluo-4-AM (1.6 uM in HBSS and 2.5 mM probenicid) for 1 hour at 37 C. After washing, the cells are transferred to the FLIPR. The test compounds are added at different concentrations (<=100 uM) in HBSS in the presence of 0.1% BSA and changes in fluorescence are recorded (indication of agonism).
Binding Assay: Membranes were prepared from CHO cells expressing human S1P1. Cells pellets (1x 108 cells/pellet) were suspended in buffer containing 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA and Protease Inhibitor cocktail (Roche), and disrupted on ice using the Polytron homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 20,000 rpm (48,000 g) and the supernatant was discarded. The membrane pellets were resuspended in buffer containing 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 2 mM EDTA and stored in aliquots at -800C after protein concentration determination. Membranes (2 ug/well) and 0.03 nM final concentration of 33P-S1P ligand (1 mCi/ml, American Radiolabeled Chemicals) diluted in assay buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH7.4, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, 0.5% fatty acid free BSA, 1 mM NaF) were added to the compound plates (384 Falcon v-bottom plate (0.5 ul/well in a 11 point, 3-fold dilution).

Boston, Mass.) in the presence of varying concentrations of either unlabeled MCP-1 (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn.) or test compound for 2 hours at 30° C. in a 96 well plate. Cells were then harvested onto a filter plate, dried, and 20 μL of Microscint 20 was added to each well. Plates were counted in a TopCount NXT, Microplate Scintillation & Luminescence Counter (Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences, Inc. Boston, Mass.). Blank values (buffer only) were subtracted from all values and drug treated values were compared to vehicle treated values. 1 μM cold MCP-1 was used for nonspecific binding.
Lance cAMP Assay: Determination of antagonistic activity of compounds of general formula 1 towards 5-HT6 receptors. Compounds of general formula 1 were tested for their ability to prevent 5-HT6 receptor activation by serotonin. HEK 293 cells (cells of human embryo's kidney) with artificially expressed 5-HT6 receptor, activation of which by serotonin leads to increasing the concentration of intracellular cAMP were used. The content of intracellular cAMP was determined using reagent kit LANCE cAMP (PerkinElmer) according to the method described by the manufacturer of the kit [http://las.perkinelmer.com/content/Manuals/MAN_LANCEcAMP384KitUser.pdf]. Effectiveness of compounds was estimated by their ability to reduce the content of intracellular cAMP induced by serotonin.
Binding Assay: Membranes were prepared from CHO cells expressing human S1P1. Cells were dissociated in buffer containing 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA and Protease Inhibitor cocktail (Roche), and disrupted on ice using the Polytron homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 20,000 rpm (48,000 G) and the supernatant was discarded. The membrane pellets were resuspended in buffer containing 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 2 mM EDTA and stored in aliquots at −80° C. after protein concentration determination. Membranes (2 μg/well) and 0.03 nM final concentration of 33P-S1P ligand (1 mCi/ml, American Radiolabeled Chemicals) were added to the compound plates. Binding was performed for 45 minutes at room temperature, terminated by collecting the membranes onto GF/B filter plates, and radioactivity was measured by TOPCOUNT®. The competition data of the test compounds over a range of concentrations was plotted as percentage inhibition of radioligand specific binding.

This tested whether the substances can inhibit the binding of a radioactively labeled PAR1 agonist known from the literature at the PAR1 receptor (Ho-Sam Ahn, Mol Pharm, 51:350-356, 1997).The human PAR1 receptor was expressed transiently in High Five insect cells. From these cells, after 48 hours, a membrane preparation was produced by standard methods, aliquoted into 10 mM Tris-HCl; 0.3 mM EDTA; 1 mM EGTA; 250 mM sucrose pH 7.5, and stored at -80 C.The substances were preincubated with the membrane at RT for 15 minutes, then the radioligand (ALA-(para-F-Phe)-Arg-ChA-homoArg-(3,4-3H-Tyr)-NH2; approx. 40 Ci/mMol) was added. The end concentration of the radioligand in the test buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl; 10 mM MgCl2; 1 mM EGTA; 0.1% BSA; 2% DMSO) was 20 nM, that of the membrane 1 mg/ml. After an incubation time of 60 minutes, 25 uL of the mixture were transferred to a 96-well MultiScreenHTS FB microtiter filtration.

The rmGluR5 or rmGluR5 was stably expressed in a HEK 293 cell line and grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) with supplements (10% bovine calf serum, 4 mM glutamine, 100 units/mL penicillin, 100 ug/mL streptomycin and 0.75 mM G1418) at 37 C., 5% CO2. Twenty-four hours prior to assay, cells were seeded into 384-well black wall microtiter plates coated with poly-D-lysine. Just prior to assay, media was aspirated and cells dye-loaded (25 uL/well) with 3 uM Fluo-4/0.01% pluronic acid in assay buffer (Hank's Balanced Saline Solution (HBSS)): 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, plus 20 mM N-2-Hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'-2-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), pH 7.4, 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 2.5 mM probenicid).
Binding Assay: MCP-1 Receptor Binding Assay in THP-1 Cells Human monocytic cell line THP-1 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, Va., USA). The THP-1 cells were grown in RPMI-1640 (RPMI: Roswell Park Memorial Institute Medium-cell culture growth media) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 C. The cell density was maintained between 0.5x106 cells/mL.THP-1 (cells were incubated with 0.5 nM 125I labeled MCP-1 (Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences, Inc. Boston, Mass.) in the presence of varying concentrations of either unlabeled MCP-1 (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn.) or test compound for 2 hours at 30 C. in a 96 well plate. Cells were then harvested onto a filter plate, dried, and 20 uL of Microscint 20 was added to each well. Plates were counted in a TopCount NXT, Microplate Scintillation & Luminescence Counter (Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences, Inc. Boston, Mass.).
Enzyme Inhibition Assay: A reaction was performed on a 384-well plate (Greiner Bio One) using a reaction volume of 24 µL, and all the samples were diluted with an assay buffer (50 mM tris buffer, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol). 0.8 mM NADPH, 6 mM glucose 6-phosphate, 0.35 units/mL glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (Sigma Chemical), and 3 mM magnesium chloride and a microsome fraction as an enzyme source were added to the plate, and a solution containing a test compound dissolved in a dimethyl sulfoxide/methanol solution was added at a final concentration of 0.1%. After the addition of the test compound, cortisone at a final concentration of 160 nM was added to start the reaction, and the reaction was performed at room temperature for 3 h. 25 µL of 100 mM carbenoxolone (Sigma Chemical) was added to terminate the reaction, and the amount of cortisol produced was measured with RUBYstar (BMG LABTECH JAPAN Ltd.) using a cortisol prototype kit (Cisbio International) according to the package insert.
Scintillation Proximity Assay: The inhibition of a microsomal preparation of 11beta -HSD1 by compounds of the invention was measured essentially as previously described (K. Solly, S. S. Mundt, H. J. Zokian, G. J. Ding, A. Hermanowski-Vosatka, B. Strulovici, and W. Zheng, High-Throughput Screening of 11-Beta-Hydroxyseroid Dehydrogenase Type 1 in Scintillation Proximity Assay Format. Assay Drug Dev Technol 3 (2005) 377-384). All reactions were carried out at rt in 96 well clear flexible PET Microbeta plates (PerkinElmer). The assay begins by dispensing 49 ul of substrate solution (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 2 mM NADPH and 160 nM [3H]cortisone (1 Ci/mmol)) and mixing in 1 uL of the test compounds in DMSO previously diluted in half-log increments (8 points) starting at 0.1 mM. After a 10 minute pre-incubation, 50 uL of enzyme solution containing microsomes isolated from CHO cells overexpressing human 11beta -HSD1 (10-20 ug/ml of total protein) was added.
Binidng Assay: First, amyloid beta peptides (1-40, Peptide Institute, Minoh-shi, Osaka) were dissolved in a 50 mM phosphate buffer containing 100 mM sodium chloride (pH 7.5) such that the concentration of the amyloid beta peptides was 100 mM, and then the solution was left to stand for 16 hours at 30 C., thereby producing amyloid beta peptide aggregates. To these amyloid beta peptide, amyloid beta peptide aggregates that had been prepared in advance by the same method and sonicated for 30 minutes under 28-45-100 KHz variation were added by a 1/1000 quantity, whereby uniform amyloid beta peptide aggregates were prepared.The amyloid beta peptide aggregates prepared by the above method, thioflavin-T, and a measurement compound were added in a 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) such that the final concentrations thereof were 1 uM, 3 uM, and 0.02 to 20 uM, respectively. The resultant solution was cause to react for 30 minutes at 23 C. with the light shielded.
Calcium Fluorescence Assay: The assay is based on the detection of intracellular calcium changes detected by the selective, calcium-chelating dye, Fluo-4 (Molecular Probes). A large fluorescence intensity increase is observed upon calcium association with Fluo-4. The dye is delivered to the cell interior using an acetoxymethylester form of Fluo-4, where the intracellular esterase activity results in the charged species being released and trapped within the cytoplasm of the cell. hence, influx of calcium to this cytoplasmic pocket, via release from intracellular pools and the phospholipase C cascade can be detected. By co-expressing the CXCR2 receptor and the promiscuous Galpha 16 protein, activation of this chemokine receptor is directed into this phospholipase C cascade resulting in intracellular calcium mobilization.The CHOK1 cells stably transfected with human CXCR2 and the promiscuous Galpha 16 protein were maintained in a log phase of growth at 37 C. and 5% CO2 in the following media: Iscove's.
Binding Assay: Platelet membranes are incubated with 12 nM [3H]haTRAP and test substance in different concentrations in a buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 10 mM magnesium chloride, 1 mM EGTA, 0.1% BSA) at room temperature for 80 min. Then the mixture is transferred to a filter plate and washed twice with buffer. After addition of scintillation liquid, the radioactivity on the filter is measured in a beta counter.
In Vitro Inhibition Assay: An in vitro assay showed inhibition of CXCR2-mediated intracellular calcium release. Briefly, human neutrophils were suspended in HBSS- (without Ca2+ and Mg2+) containing 10 mM HEPES and FLIPR Calcium 3 dye (3.1x107 cells in total volume 1.7 mL). Cells were aliquoted (200 uL of the cell suspension per tube, 8 tubes total) and 2 uL of the designated compound (with appropriate dilutions) were added to each of 6 tubes. As controls, 2 uL of DMSO (1% final concentration) were added to 2 other tubes. Cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 C. After dye loading, tubes were centrifuged at 6,000 rpm for 1 min, supernatant was removed and the cell pellet was re-suspended in 200 uL of HBSS+ (with Ca2+ and Mg2+) containing 10 mM HEPES. The test compound or DMSO (control) was added again at the same concentrations that were used during cell loading. The cell suspension was aliquoted into a 96-well Reading Plate (Corning) in a volume of 90 uL (105 cells/well).
TR-FRET Tracer Assay: IC50s for mTOR interacting compounds were assessed using the FRAP1/mTOR TR-FRET tracer assay (Invitrogen by Life Technologies). FRAP1/mTOR (PV4753) and LanthaScreen Eu-Anti-GST Antibody (PV5594) (total volume of 14 uL) were added to each well of a ProxiPlate-384 Plus (Perkin-Elmer) 384-well plate. Compounds were serially diluted in DMSO (12-point, 4x dilution factor) and 1 uL of diluted compound was then added to each well and mixed by pipetting using a Biomek FX (Beckman Coulter). 5 uL of mTOR Kinase Tracer 314 (PV6087) was added to each well, mixed and plates were incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. Final concentrations of components are: 6 nM FRAP1/3 nM LanthaScreen Eu-Anti-GST Antibody/50 nM mTOR Kinase Tracer 314/unlabeled compounds, 4.8*10^-6-20 uM. Final assay buffer composition is: 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 0.01% Pluronic F-127. Plates were measured in plate reader (Perkin Elmer, EnVision) using 340 nm excitation.
Binding Assay: A whole cell receptor binding assay using [3H]ramatroban as the competing radioactive ligand was employed to evaluate the compound binding activity to human CRTH2. The radioactive ligand [3H]ramatroban was synthesized according to Sugimoto et. al. (Eur. J. Pharmacol. 524, 30-37, 2005) to a specific activity of 42 Ci/mmol.A cell line stably expressing human CRTH2 was established by transfecting CHO-K1 cells with two mammalian expression vectors that harbored human CRTH2 and G-alpha16 cDNAs, respectively, using FuGene 6 transfection reagent (from Roche). Stable clones expressing CRTH2 were selected by staining each clone with BM16 (BD Pharmingen from BD Biosciences, a division of Becton, Dickinson and Company), which is a rat monoclonal antibody to human CRTH2. The cells were maintained as monolayer cultures in Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/mL penicillin, 100 ug/mL streptomycin, 2 mM glutamine, 0.5 mg/mL G418 (geneticin) for CRTH2.
Fluorometric Imaging Plate Reader (FLIPR) Assay: Cell Culture Conditions: CHO-K1 cells previously transfected with G-alpha 16 were subsequently transfected with the human CRTH2 receptor and the neomycin resistance gene. Following selection in 800 ug/mL G418 (geneticin), individual clones were assayed for their receptor expression based on staining with an anti human CRTH2 IgG, followed by assaying for their response to 13,14-dihydro-15-keto Prostaglandin D2 (DK-PDG2) (ligand) in the Ca2+ Flux assay. Positive clones were then cloned by limiting dilution cloning. The transfected cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin/100 ug/mL streptomycin, 200 ug/mL hygromycin B, and 800 ug/mL G418 (geneticin). Cells were harvested with trypsin-EDTA (trypsin-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) and counted using ViaCount reagent (from Guava Technologies, Inc. which contains two DNA-binding dyes.

Biochemical Alpha Screen Assay: A biotin labeled peptide is used as substrate (amino acid sequence: Biotin-Glu-Gly-Pro-Trp-Leu-Glu-Glu-Glu-Glu-Glu-Ala-Tyr-Gly-Trp-Met-Asp-Phe-NH2)1SEQ ID NO: 1). FAK enzyme was expressed in insect cells as catalytic domain (amino acids 411-686)N-terminally tagged with six histidine amino acids and a Tobacco Etch Virus (TeV) cleavage sequence. After lysing the cells by sonication, the kinase was purified by Ni-Immobilised Metal Affinity Chromatography chromatography, TeV cleavage leaving a N-terminal glycine, and gel filtration. The 15 ul assay reactions are run in Greiner brand white 384-well low volume plates. All reactions contained 10 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 25 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.01% (v/v) Tween-20, 50 uM Na3V04, 0.01% (w/v) albumin from chicken egg white, 111 nM peptide substrate, 80 uM ATP, and 4 ng/reaction FAK enzyme, with the enzyme being omitted from negative control reactions.

The plates were sealed with adhesive seals and incubated for 90 minutes at 30 degree.
Phospho ELISA Assay: Adult human dermal lymphatic microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC-dLyAD) (Cat# CC-2810, Lonza) were seeded into clear-bottom, TC treated 12 well plates (Cat #665180, Greiner Bio-One) in Endogro MV complete (Cat#SCME004, Millipore) at 200,000 cells/well (volume 1 mL), and the plates incubated at 37 C. and 5% CO2 for 6 hours. The media was replaced with Endogro Basal (Cat # SCME-BM, Millipore)+0.1% BSA (Cat# A8412, Sigma) and cells incubated for a further period (overnight at 37 C. and 5% CO2).96 well Maxisorp immuno plates (Cat #439454, Nunc) were coated with 100 uL of Total VEGFR2 capture antibody (Part #841888, Human Total VEGFR3/Flt4 ELISA Kit, Cat # DYC3491, R&D Systems), or Phospho VEGF R3Capture antibody (Part #841885, Human Phospho VEGF R3/Flt4 ELISA Kit, Cat# DYC2724, R&D Systems). The plates were covered and incubated at room temperature overnight. The coating antibody was flicked out and the plates washed three times with Wash Buffer.
FLIPR Assay: Activation of the mGluR5 receptor expressed in cell lines results in an increase in intracellular calcium concentration. Using calcium sensitive fluorescent dyes and a suited fluorescence plate reader this functional response is detectable and quantifiable. This technique could be used to characterize pharmacological modifications of the mGluR5 receptor.[Ca]i measurements were performed in HEK293 cells stably expressing the full-length human mGlu5a receptor under the control of a tet-regulated promoter. Cells were cultivated in Dulbecco's modified eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 ug/ml HygromycinB, 500 ug/ml G418 and 2 ug/ml Tetracycline in a 37, 95% humidity and 5% CO2 incubator. Confluent cell cultures were split on a bi-weekly schedule.72 hours prior to the assay run mGluR5a expression was induced by replacing the culture medium by DMEM with 10% fetal calf serum without antibiotics.
SPA Assay: The H3 binding assay was/can be used to evaluate the ability of at least one compound in accordance with formula I, Ia, Ib, and/or Ic to inhibit [3H]-N-α-methylhistamine binding to CHO-K1 membranes expressing human histamine H3 receptors (full-length H3, the most prevalent brain isoform 445). In 200 μl 96-well SPA format, human H3 membranes (12.5 μg protein/well) and 1.4 nM [3H]-N-α-methylhistamine were/can be incubated with at least one compound in accordance with formula I, Ia, Ib, and/or Ic for 1.5 hrs to determine percent effect with respect to total (1% DMSO) and non-specific binding (10 μM imetit). Reproducibility of the assay is such that IC50 curves can be generated in singlicate.
Guanosine 5'-O-(3-[35S]thio)triphosphate [GTP gamma S] Binding Assay: A GTP gamma S binding assay can be used to investigate antagonist properties of compounds in CHO cells (Chinese Hamster Ovary) transfected with human Histamine H3 receptor (hH3R). Membranes from CHO cells expressing hH3R (10 ug/well) are diluted in GTP gamma S assay buffer (20 mM Hepes, 10 mM MgCl2, 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) and preincubated with saponine (3 ug/ml), GDP (10 uM) and PVT-WGA SPA beads (125 ug/well) (Amersham) for 30 minutes. To determine antagonist activity, (R)-methyl histamine (30 nM) is added in 96 well SPA plate with [35S]GTP gamma S (0.2 nM) and various concentration of H3R antagonists. The GTP gamma S binding assay is started with addition of the mixture membrane/saponine/GDP and incubated for 90 minutes at room temperature. The amount of bound [35S]GTP gamma S is determined by using the MicroBeta Trilux counter (PerkinElmer). The percentage of [35S]GTP gamma S bound in each sample is calculated as a percentage of that bound control sample.
FLIPR Calcium Assay: Antagonizing effect of compounds for human GnRHR1 was evaluated by change of calcium levels in GnRH-stimulated cells. After removing the culture medium of HEK293 cells transiently expressing human GnRHR1, cells were washed with 200 .mu.L piper well of the washing buffer (Hank's Balanced Salt Solutions, 20 mM N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'-2-ethanesulfonic acid, 1.3 mM calcium chloride, 0.5 mM magnesium chloride, 0.4 mM magnesium sulfate). One hundred .mu.L of the Ca.sup.2+sensitive dye solution (FLIPR Calcium Assay Kit (Molecular Devices)) was added to the well, and the cells were incubated for 1 hour at 37.degree. C., 5% CO.sub.2. Then, intracellular calcium levels were determined under the following condition by using FLEX STATION (Molecular Devices). In the equipment, which was warmed to 37.degree. C., 50 .mu.L of test compound diluted with the measurement buffer (the washing buffer with 0.1% Albumin bovine serum) was added to the well.
Flux Assay: As Ca2+ flux is associated with the activation of the MOR, the functional activity of bivalent ligand 1, monovalent ligand 2, and naltrexone was then evaluated in a Ca2+ mobilization assay in hMORCHO cells transfected with chimeric Ca2+ following a published protocol.23 No agonism was observed for any of the tested compounds (data not shown). Thus, they were further assessed for their antagonist properties as the ability to inhibit DAMGO (a MOR agonist) induced Ca2+ flux.
Flux Assay: Then the Ca2+ functional activity of bivalent ligand 1 was evaluated in the Gqi5 transfected CCR5-MOLT-4 cells as described in the literature.3 As expected, no CCR5 agonism was detected for the bivalent ligand 1 (data not shown). In the RANTES induced Ca2+ flux inhibition assay (Table 3), the bivalent ligand 1 was approximately 60-fold less potent than maraviroc. A more significant potency decrease (nearly 300 times) was observed for the monovalent ligand 3, compared to maraviroc. In order to figure out the possible reasons for such a dramatic drop of their potency, two analogues (4 and 5, FIG. 14) of mavaviroc carrying gradient steric hindrance characters at the same substitution position were evaluated under the same condition. Compound 4 showed a modest reduction of the potency (Table 2). However, the inhibition potency of the N-t-Boc protected analogue 5 dropped to micromolar (IC50=1.57+/-0.18 uM). It thus appeared that steric hindrance may play an essential role.
In Vitro Inhibition Assay: The assay protocol employed was a modified version of that described in Li et al., 2000, Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA 97:6183-643, incorporated herein by reference. Briefly, recombinant peptide substrate was incubated with γ-secretase (40 μg/ml) in the presence or absence of test compound. The reaction mixture contained 0.25% CHAPSO, 0.1 μg/μl BSA, protease inhibitor, 50 mM PIPES, pH 7.0, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM CaCl2 and 150 mM KCl. The reaction was incubated for 2.5 hr at 37° C. and stopped by adding RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1.0% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mM Tris HCl, pH 8.0). The products were detected with various antibody combinations using electrochemiluminescence (ECL) technology as previously described in Li et al., 2000, Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA 97:6183-643; Lai et al., 2003, J. Biol. Chem. 278: 22475-22481; and Yin et al., 2007, J. Biol. Chem. 282:23639-23644.
Inhibition Assay: Chinese hamster ovary cells are transfected with the human gene for amyloid precursor protein. The cells are plated at a density of 8000 cells/well into 96-well microtiter plates and cultivated for 24 hours in DMEM cell culture medium containing 10% FCS. The test compound is added to the cells at various concentrations, and the cells are cultivated for 24 hours in the presence of the test compound. The supernatants are collected, and the concentration of amyloid peptide 1-40 is determined using state of the art immunoassay techniques, for example sandwich ELISA, homogenous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF) immunoassay, or electro-chemiluminescence immunoassay. The potency of the compound is calculated from the percentage of inhibition of amyloid peptide release as a function of the test compound concentration.

The assay detection mixture contained the LANCE Eu-W8044 labeled streptavidin 1/2250 (supplied in 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl buffer).
Adenosine A3 Receptor Radioligand Binding Assay: .(R)- and (S)-(4-Fluorophenyl)(4-((5-methyl-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)amino)quinazolin-2-yl)methanol was tested in a radioligand binding assay, according to the procedure described in Olah et al., Mol. Pharmacol. 1994, 45, 978-982 and Salvatore et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993, 90, 10365-10369, in human recombinant CHO-K1 cells expressing the human adenosine A3 receptor. Incubations of a range of concentration of each compound were carried out in duplicates for 1 h at 25° C. in 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, 0.1% BSA, in the presence of 0.5 nM [125I] AB-MECA. Non-specific binding was determined in the presence of 1 uM IB-MECA.
Binding Assay: The synthesized substances were examined in a PAR1 binding test. This tested whether the substances can inhibit the binding of a radioactively labeled PAR1 agonist known from the literature at the PAR1 receptor (Ho-Sam Ahn, Mol Pharm, 51:350-356, 1997). The human PAR1 receptor was expressed transiently in High Five insect cells. From these cells, after 48 hours, a membrane preparation was produced by standard methods, aliquoted into 10 mM Tris-HCl; 0.3 mM EDTA; 1 mM EGTA; 250 mM sucrose pH 7.5, and stored at -80 C.The substances were preincubated with the membrane at room temperature for 15 minutes, then the radioligand (ALA-(para-F-Phe)-Arg-ChA-homoArg-(3,4-3H-Tyr)-NH2; approx. 40 Ci/mMol) was added. The end concentration of the radioligand in the test buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl; 10 mM MgCl2; 1 mM EGTA; 0.1% BSA; 2% DMSO) was 20 nM, that of the membrane 1 mg/ml. After an incubation time of 60 minutes, 25 uL of the mixture were transferred to a 96-well MultiScreenHTS FB.
Radioligand Displacement Assay: Binding assay was performed in a final assay volume of 250 ul. First, 25 ul of test compound, previously diluted in Binding-Buffer (Binding-Buffer: 50 mM Tris-Base, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% BSA (protease free), 0.01% NaN3, 10 mM MnCl2 pH 7.0) was placed into each well. After addition of 75 ul Binding-Buffer, 50 ul of the radioligand 3H-PGD2 (at 2.5 nM (220.000 dpm/well) from ANAWA ART0662) was added to each well. Binding assay was started by addition of 100 ul CRTH2 membrane fragments, reaching a final concentration of 20 ug/well. For non-specific binding, PGD2 was added to the reaction mixture to 10 mM final concentration. This assay mix was incubated for 90 minutes at room temperature and then filtered through a GF/C filter 96-well plate which was pre-soaked for 3 hours in 0.5% polyethyleneimine (PEI). The filter-wells were washed three times with ice cold Binding-Buffer. Then, 40 ul of Microscint-40 (Packard) was added to each well.
Biological Assay: For mTOR enzyme activity assays, mTOR protein was isolated from HeLa cell cytoplasmic extract by immunoprecipitation, and activity determined essentially as described previously using recombinant PHAS-1as a substrate (ref 21).

Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley and Sons, NY, NY (1995)). The essential coding sequences were subcloned into pCDNA 3.1 (Invitrogen) to produce a P2Y1 expression construct. This construct was then transfected into the human embryonic kidney cell line HEK-293 and stable transfectants selected in GENETICIN (G418 sulfate; Life Technologies). Several lines were screened for binding activity and one (HEK293 #49) selected for further characterization. Membranes were prepared by growing HEK293 #49 in 150 mm dishes in DMEM/10% FBS in the presence of lmg/ml G418 until cells were 80-90% confluent. Plates were then washed with cold (4 C) D-PBS twice.

GTPyS binding assay: Test compound and/or vehicle was preincubated with the cell membranes and 3 uM GDP in modified HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) for 20 minutes, followed by addition of SPA beads for another 60 minutes at 30° C. The reaction is initiated by 0.3 nM [35S]GTP gamma S for an additional 30 minutes incubation period. Test compound-induced increase of [35S]GTP gamma S binding by 50 percent or more (250%) relative to the receptor subtype-specific agonist response indicates possible opiate receptor agonist activity. 0.1 uM DPDPE, 1 uM U-69593 and 1 uM DAMGO were used as the specific agonists for the delta, kappa and mu opioid receptors respectively. Opioid receptor antagonist activity was measured using inhibition of agonist-induced increase of [35S]GTP gammaS binding response by 50 percent or more (250%). Nalbuphine, 6-O-mPEG3-Nalbuphine, 6-O-mPEG6-Nalbuphine, 6-O-mPEG9-Nalbuphine were screened at concentrations of 10, 1, 0.1, 0.01 and 0.001 uM in both agonist and antagonist mode. EC50 or IC50 values were calculated from the dose-response curves as a measure of the agonist or antagonist activity of the test compounds respectively.

The binding reactions were terminated by filtration and washing with 2.5 volumes of Tris/HCl 50 mM pH=7.4.
Muscarinic Receptor Binding Assay: The study of binding to human muscarinic M1, M2, M3, M4 and M5 receptors was performed using commercial membranes (Perkin Elmer) prepared from CHO-K1 cells. Radioligand binding experiments were conducted in 96 polypropylene well plates in a total volume of 200 μl. All reagents were dissolved in assay binding buffer (PBS with calcium and magnesium, SIGMA), except compounds that were dissolved in DMSO 100%. Non-specific binding (NSB) was measured in the presence of 1 μM atropine. [3H]-NMS was used as the radioligand at a concentration of 1 nM for M2, M3 and M5 and 0.3 nM for M1 and M4.

To prepare serial dilutions, 10 mM stocks of compounds were prepared in 100% DMSO. The compound dilution plate was set up as follows: well #1 received 29 μL of stock compound and 31 μL DMSO. Wells 2-10 received 40 μL of DMSO. After mixing, 20 μL of solution from well #1 was transferred into well #2, followed by 1:3 serial dilutions out 10 steps. 2 μL of diluted compound was transferred into duplicate wells of 384 well "assay plate" and then 90 μL of buffer was added. After incubation, both the cell and "assay" plates were brought to the FLIPR and 20 μL of the diluted compounds were transferred to the cell plates by the FLIPR. Compound addition was monitored by the FLIPR to detect any agonist activity of the compounds. Plates were then incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature protected from light. After the incubation, plates were returned to the FLIPR and 20 μL of 4.5× concentrated agonist was added to the cell plates. During the assay, fluorescence readings were taken simultaneously from all 384 wells of the cell plate every 1.5 seconds. Five readings were taken to establish a stable baseline, then 20 μL of sample was rapidly (30 μL/sec) and simultaneously added to each well of the cell plate. The fluorescence was continuously monitored before, during and after sample addition for a total elapsed time of 100 seconds.

Membrane preparations from stably transfected chinese hamster ovary-K1 cells (CHO) expressing the genes for the human muscarinic receptors Hm3 were used.
Radioligand Binding Assay: Assessments of compound binding to human MC5R (hMC5R)) by displacement of an 125I-labeled NDP-MSH receptor ligand peptide were performed essentially as described in the data sheets produced by Perkin Elmer to accompany their frozen hMC5R membranes (Perkin Elmer catalog number RBXMC5M400UA). [125I] NDP-MSH: Radiolabeled in House and Purified by HPLC: Na125I (0.5 mCi, 17.4 Ci/mg) was added to 50 μL sodium phosphate (50 mM, pH 7.4) in an eppendorf tube precoated with IODOGEN. After incubation for 10 mins the phosphate buffer containing the iodine was added to NDP-MSH (10 μl at 1 mg/mL) in a separate eppendorf tube. This was incubated for a further 10 mins. The iodinated NDP-MSH was purified by HPLC on a Zorbax SB 300 column using solvent A: 0.05% TFA and solvent B: 90% acetonitrile 0.045% TFA with a linear gradient, 0-67% B over 60 mins. The 125I NDP-MSH eluted at 52 mins after the unlabeled starting material (48 min) and was counted and stored in the freezer. It was used within 48 hrs, as radioactive decay and ligand decomposition resulted in greatly reduced specific binding observed after 72 hrs. Incubation buffer: 25 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.0), 1.5 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgSO4, 0.1 M NaCl, 1 mM 1,10-phenanthroline, and 1 Complete™ protease inhibitor tablet/100 mL (Roche, catalog number 1873580). Perkin Elmer frozen hMC5 membranes: catalog number RBXMC5M400UA, 0.4 mL/vial; 400 microassays/vial, 0.78 mg/mL protein concentration. Vials of frozen membranes were thawed rapidly immediately before use, diluted with binding buffer and vortexed. Resuspended membranes were kept on ice until they were added to the wells of the plate. Assays were performed in 96 well polypropylene plates. Membranes (0.78 μg 40 μL of a 1:40 dilution in incubation buffer) were added to [125I] NDP-MSH (0.84 nM; 2200 Ci/mmol) and test compounds in a total volume of 140 μL. This was incubated for 1 hr at 37° C. Non-specific binding was determined with 3 mM NDP-MSH. Plates were filtered using a Tomtec cell harvester with GF/A filters (Wallac) (presoaked in 0.6% polyethylenimine) and washed three times with 1.0 mL ice-cold wash buffer (the above incubation buffer without 1,10-phenanthroline and Complete™ protease inhibitor tablet). The filters were dried in a 37° C. oven, placed in a sample bag and 5 mL Betaplatescint (Wallac) was added. Prepared filters were counted in cassettes in a Microbeta Trilux (Wallac) for 1 min.
Radioligand Binding Assay: Radioligand binding assays were carried out using commercial or in-house prepared hMC1R, hMC3R and hMC4R membranes and [125I] NDP-MSH, as per the hMC5R procedure in Example 102. In-house plasma membranes were prepared from transfected mammalian cells (prepared as in Example 109, using plasmid DNA containing the human MC1R, MC3R or MC4R gene or other gene of interest in a plasmid vector with a mammalian origin of replication): Adherent cells were washed with warm Hanks buffered saline solution (HBSS). 1 mL of cold HBSS was added to each flask and the cells were scraped off with a rubber policeman. The scraped cells were added to a 50 mL tube on ice. The plates were then rinsed twice with 5 mL cold HBSS and this was also added to the tube. The cells were centrifuged at 1000×g for 5 mins in a bench top centrifuge and the supernatant was decanted. The remaining cell pellet was resuspended in 0.25 M sucrose. The cell suspension was centrifuged again as previously and the pellet resuspended in 5 mL of 0.25 M sucrose containing protease inhibitors. The cells were homogenised by a 10 second pulse with an Ika disperser followed by 30 seconds on ice. The homogenisation and ice incubation was repeated three times. The mixture was then centrifuged at 1260×g for 5 mins. The supernatant was decanted into another centrifuge tube, to which a buffer containing 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 12.5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM EGTA and protease inhibitors was added to make the volume up to 30 mL. This was centrifuged at 30,000×g for 90 mins at 4° C. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 1 mL of the buffer above also containing 10% glycerol. Membranes were aliquoted into cryovials which were snap-frozen in a dry-ice/ethanol bath before being stored at −80° C. until required for use.
FLIPR Assay: HEK 293 Cells were grown in media containing DMEM, 10% FBS pen/strep/L-Glutamine and non-essential amino acids. The cells were plated in 384-well PDL coated plates at 12000 cells/well and incubated overnight at 37° C./5% CO2. Media was then removed from the cells, which were then incubated with buffer (Hank's containing HEPES and Chaps) containing FLIPR calcium-5 dye, made with buffer containing probenecid, for 60 minutes at 37° C. Varying concentrations of compound in a final concentration of 5% DMSO were then added to the cells and incubated at 25° C. for 30 minutes. The plates were then added to the FLIPR Tetra and the device added a concentration of a PAR1 selective receptor-activating peptide with the sequence Ala-parafluoroPhe-Arg-Cha-Cit-Try-Nh2 (prepared in water) at a concentration equal to the effective concentration that achieves 80% activation of signaling on the day of the experiment.

To a tube containing the cell membrane fraction of the CHO with human GnRH receptors expressed were added 2 μl of a solution of 2 mM compound in 60% DMSO and 10 μl of 38 nM 125I-leuprorelin. To determine maximum binding quantity, a reaction mixture containing 2 μl of 60% DMSO and 10 μl of 38 nM 125I-leuprorelin was prepared. To determine non-specific binding amount, a reaction mixture containing 2 μl of a solution of 100 μM leuprorelin in 60% DMSO and 10 μl of 38 nM 125I-leuprorelin was prepared.

Up to 80 μl of prepared PDE4B enzyme solution was transferred into alternate wells on row 'N' of 384-well plate starting from cell N1. Up to 80 μl of prepared PDE4D enzyme solution was transferred into alternate wells on row 'O' of 384-well plate, starting from cell O2. cAMP substrate solution was transferred into bottom row of separate 96-well plate. 5 μl of enzyme solution from the "reservoir" row (N or O) was transferred to each of the wells containing compounds, per layout map. Next, 10 μl of cAMP substrate was transferred to these wells. The order of substrate-first or enzyme-first can be switched depending on what is optimal. The final cAMP concentration was 100 nM in the reaction. 20 μl of assay buffer was pipetted into 4 separate wells−these are the blanks. The plate was sealed with an aluminum strip and incubated at 30° C. for 90 minutes. A TR-FRET solution was prepared. 4 ml of 1×IMAP Buffer A was added to 6 ml of IMAP Buffer B. 25 μl ( 1/800 of 20 ml) of binding beads was added to this and mix by inverting. 60 μl of this mixture was pipetted into 2 of the wells containing the "blank" assay buffer. Next, 49.7 μl ( 1/400 of remaining volume) of Tb donor solution was added to the remaining TR-FRET solution and mixed by inverting. 60 μl of this solution was pipetted into remaining 2 "blank" assay buffer-containing wells. The TR-FRET solution was poured into a pipette boat and a multichannel pipette was used to drop 60 μl of solution into all assay wells. The wells were covered with a foil strip and incubated for at least 3 hours or overnight protected from light (e.g. in a drawer) at room temperature.

cAMP Assay: Cells were seeded at a density of 10,000 cells per well in poly-L-lysine treated 96-well culture plates (BD Biosciences). The following day wells were incubated with 40 μl DMEM/F12 containing 0.5% (w/v) BSA and 0.5 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 minutes prior to 15 min stimulation with 50 μM forskolin (Tocris Cookson) and varying concentrations of indicated compounds at 37° C., 5% CO2. Assays were stopped by removal of media and addition of 100% ice cold ethanol. Plates were then frozen for a minimum of two hours before complete evaporation of ethanol. The well contents were then reconstituted in 50 μl cAMP assay buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5 and 5 mM EDTA). Half of the reconstituted sample was transferred to round bottom 96-well plates (Greiner Bio-One GmbH) with 50 μl 0.01% w/v PKA (cAMP dependent protein kinase (Sigma-Aldrich) in 1 mM Na citrate pH 6.5 with 2 mM dithiothreitol) and 25 μl [3H]-cAMP (at 22 nM in cAMP assay buffer) (GE Healthcare, Life Sciences). This was allowed to equilibrate for 3-18 hours. Following this a charcoal slurry (5% (w/v) activated charcoal and 0.2% (w/v) BSA in cAMP assay buffer) was added to the samples and the plates centrifuged at 3000×g, 4° C. for 5 min.

Detection solution: a detection solution containing 2-fold final concentrations of EDTA and 4EBP1 phosphorylated antibody was formulated, wherein the final concentration for EDTA was 8 mM, and the final concentration for the 4EBP phosphorylated antibody was 2 nM. Procedure: To each well of a 384-well plate was added 2.5 μL of the 4-fold test substance solutions in gradient concentrations. The replication was made. To each well was added 2.5 μL of 4-fold kinase solution, and then the plate was incubated for 10 mins. Then to each well was added 5 μL/of 2-fold substrate and ATP solution, and then the plate was incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. Finally, 10 μL of the detection solution was added to terminate the reaction. After 60 mins, the data Lance signal (665 nM) was read from Envision.
In Vitro Affinity Assay: â¿¿PathHunter HEK293-CXCR2â¿ or â¿¿U2OS hCXCR1 β-arrestinâ¿ cells (DiscoveRx Corporation) were seeded overnight at 10 000 cells/well (384-well format) in 20 μl of Opti MEM I medium. A preincubation with the antagonist or the vehicle for 30 min at 37° C. and 5% CO2 was followed by 60 minutes of stimulation with CXCL8 at 37° C. and 5% CO2. The cells were then placed at ambient temperature for 30 minutes. The PathHunter detection reagent (DiscoveRx Corporation) was added. After incubation for 60 min at ambient temperature, the β-galactosidase induced by the luminescence during the β-arrestin-CXCR2 interaction was measured for 0.3 s in an Envision 2102 Multilabel Reader (PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences).
Binding Assay: The binding assays were performed by testing the ability of the new compounds to displace the radiolabeled synthetic non-selective cannabinoid agonist [3H]CP55940 (168 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer) from the human CB1 (hCB1) or human CB2 (hCB2) receptors on membranes derived from stably transfected HEK-293 cells (PerkinElmer). Membranes were diluted in assay buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mg/ml BSA, pH=7.4). The amount of membrane was determined for each batch of membranes according to protein binding assay. The minimum amount of membrane that gave 50% specific binding was used for the binding assay. In most assays, binding was tested using 8 μg and 4 μg protein of hCB1 and hCB2 membranes, respectively. The tested compounds were dissolved in DMSO and diluted in assay buffer to a final concentration of 0.1% solvent. Total binding of [3H]CP55940 was evaluated with 1.5 nM to hCB1 and with 0.5 nM to hCB2, according to Kd affinity of [3H]CP55940 for the respective membranes. The ability of the tested compounds to displace [3H]CP55940 was evaluated first at a single concentration point of 100 nM for binding toward hCB2 or hCB1. In certain cases, the displacement was tested at compound concentrations ranging from 0.03 nM to 10 μM. Non-specific binding was measured by the addition of 1 μM of unlabelled CP55940 to the tubes. Binding assays were performed in triplicate in a total volume of 500 μl for 60 minutes at 30° C., in a shaking bath. Free and bound radioligands were separated by rapid filtration through GF/C filter plates (PerkinElmer) that had been presoaked with 0.1% Polyethylenimine (Sigma). Filters were shaken for 1 hour in 7 ml scintillation fluid (PerkinElmer) and radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counter (Wallac; PerkinElmer).

[125I]DOI Radioligand Binding Assay.: Radioligand binding assays for human 5-HT2A serotonin receptor was conducted using the 5-HT2 agonist [125I]DOI as radioligand. To define nonspecific binding, 10 μM DOI was used for all assays. For competitive binding studies, 0.5 nM [125I]DOI was used and compounds were assayed over a range of 0.01 nM to 10 μM. Assays were conducted in a total volume of 200 μl in 96-well Perkin Elmer GF/C filter plates in assay buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 mM EDTA, 5 mM MgCl2, and 10 μM pargyline). Assay incubations were performed for 60 min at room temperature and were terminated by rapid filtration under vacuum pressure of the reaction mixture over Whatman GF/C glass fiber filters presoaked in 0.5% PEI using a Brandell cell harvester. Filters were then washed several times with ice-cold wash buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). Plates were then dried at room temperature and counted in a Wallac MicroBeta scintillation counter.

The membrane preparations are resuspended in 3 ml of chilled Assay Buffer and homogenized by several passages through a 26 gauge needle before use in the assay.
HTRF Assay : The inhibiting activity of 11β-HSD1 derived from microsomal fractions was measured using the HTRF assay (62CO2PEB, Cisbio). Different concentrations of compounds were added to 96-well plates, followed by the addition of TE buffer (20 mM Tris buffer and 5 mM EDTA, pH 6.0) containing 200 μM NADPH (N1630, Sigma) and 160 nM cortisone (C2755, Sigma), The reactions were initiated by the addition of human microsomal fractions (M0317, Sigma), and were allowed to incubate for 2 h at 37° C. Europium (Eu3+) cryptate and XL665-conjugated cortisol were then added to each well and incubated for an additional 2 h at room temperature.
Electrochemiluminescence (ECL)-Based Immunoassay: To measure γ-secretase activity, membranes were incubated at 37° C. for 1 h in 50 μL of buffer containing 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.0) and 2 mM EDTA. At the end of the incubation, Aβ 40 and Aβ 42 were measured using an electrochemiluminescence (ECL)-based immunoassay. Aβ 40 was identified with antibody pairs TAG-G2-10 and biotin-W02, while Aβ 42 was identified with TAG-G2-11 and biotin-4G8. The ECL signal was measured using an ECL-M8 instrument (IGEN International, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
LanthaScreen Kinase Activity Assay: The enzymatic mTOR activity was measured using a LanthaScreen kinase activity assay (Invitrogen). The enzyme was purchased from Invitrogen (PV4754), as well as the GFP-labelled substrate (4EBP1-GFP; PV4759) and the Tb-antip4EBP1(pThr46) antibody (PV4757). The assay was performed in 50 Mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1.5 mM MnCl2, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 2.5 mM DTT and 0.01% Tween-20. The concentration of the assay components were the following: 0.24 nM mTOR kinase, 400 nM 4EBP1-GFP, 10 mM ATP and serial dilutions of the compound (inhibitor) to be evaluated. After 1 h incubation at room temperature, 20 mM EDTA was used to stop the reaction and terbium-labelled antibody (4 nM) added to detect phosphorylated product. The antibody associates with the phosphorylated product resulting in an increased TR-FRET value. The TR-FRET value (a dimensionless number) was calculated as the ratio of the acceptor signal (GFP, emission at 520 nm) to the donor signal (terbium, emission at 495 nm).
Receptor Assay: Engagement of the LPA5 receptor by its ligand, oleoyl-L-Î±-lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), leads to the release of intracellular stores of calcium into the cytoplasm mediated through a Gq-driven increase in inositol triphosphate (IP3) levels. Gq is a heterotrimeric G protein subunit that activates phospholipase C.The ability of test compounds to prevent LPA-driven intracellular release of stored calcium from RH7777 cells expressing human LPA5 receptors was assayed by stimulating the cells with LPA in the presence of various test compounds to measure the test compounds' antagonism, i.e. activity in vitro. Approximately 10,000 cells in normal culture medium (Minimal Essential Media, 10% Foetal Calf Serum) were dispensed per assay well in a black clear bottom poly-D-lysine coated 384 well plate (Corning).

Radioligand Binding: HEK-293 cells stably expressing the human or feline FP receptor, or EP1, EP2, EP3, or EP4 receptors were washed with TME buffer, scraped from the bottom of the flasks, and homogenized for 30 sec using a Brinkman PT 10/35 polytron. TME buffer was added to achieve a final 40 ml volume in the centrifuge tubes (the composition of TME is 100 mM TRIS base, 20 mM MgCl2, 2M EDTA; 10 N HCl is added to achieve a pH of 7.4).The cell homogenate was centrifuged at 19000 r.p.m. for 20 min at 4 C. using a Beckman Ti-60 rotor. The resultant pellet was resuspended in TME buffer to give a final 1 mg/ml protein concentration, as determined by Biorad assay. Radioligand binding competition assays vs. [3H-]17-phenyl PGF2 (5 nM) were performed in a 100 ul volume for 60 min. Binding reactions were started by adding plasma membrane fraction. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 4 ml ice-cold TRIS-HCl buffer and rapid filtration through glass fiber GF/B filters using a Brandel cell.
Cell Based Assay: Ca2+ signaling studies were performed using a FLIPR TETRA system (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif., USA) in the 384-format. This is a high-throughput instrument for cell-based assays to monitor Ca2+ signaling associated with GPCRs and ion channels. Cells were seeded at a density of 5×104 cells/well in BioCoat poly-D-lysine coated, black wall, clear bottom 384-well plates (BD Biosciences, Franklin lakes, NJ, USA) and allowed to attach overnight in an incubator at 37° C. The cells were then washed twice with HBSS-HEPES buffer (Hanks' balanced salt solution without bicarbonate and phenol red, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) using an ELx405 Select CW Microplate Washer (BioTek, Winooski, Vt., USA). After 60 min of dye-loading in the dark using the Ca2+-sensitive dye Fluo-4AM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif., USA), at a final concentration of 2×10^−6M, the plates were washed 4 times with HBSS-HEPES buffer to remove excess dye and leaving 50 μl of buffer in each well. The plates were then placed in the FLIPR TETRA instrument and allowed to equilibrate at 37° C. AGN-211377 was added in a 25 μl volume to each well to give final concentrations of 0.1 μM, 0.3 μM, 1 μM, 3 μM, 10 μM, and 30 μM; or 0.067 μM, 0.1 μM, 0.2 μM, 0.3 μM, 0.67 μM, and 1 μM for cells over-expressing TP receptors. After 4.5 minutes, a 7-point serial dilution of the standard agonist for the corresponding receptor, in a 25 μl volume was injected at the final concentrations from 10^−11M to 10^−5M in 10-fold serial dilution increments for cells expressing human recombinant DP1, EP1, EP2, EP3, EP4, FP, and IP receptors. The dose range for the standard agonist for human recombinant TP receptors was from 10^−12M to 10^−6M. HBSS-HEPES buffer was used as the negative control for the standard agonists. Cells were excited with LED (light emitting diode) excitation at 470-495 nm and emission was measured through an emission filter at 515-575 nm. Assay plates were read for 3.5 minutes using the FLIPRTETRA.

This assay measures the functional properties of a compound by quantifying the level of G-protein activation following agonist binding in studies using stably transfected cells, and is considered to be a measure of the efficacy of a compound. Membranes from CHO (Chinese Hamster Ovary) cells that stably expressed the cloned human Mu opioid receptor were used in the experiments. Specifically, in a final volume of 0.5 mL, 12 different concentrations of each test compound were incubated with 7.5 ug of CHO cell membranes that stably expressed the human mu opioid receptor. The assay buffer consisted of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EGTA, 3 uM GDP, and 100 mM NaCl. The final concentration of [35S]GTPgammaS was 0.080 nM. Nonspecific binding was measured by inclusion of 10 uM GTPgammaS. Binding was initiated by the addition of the membranes.
Mu-Opioid GTPgammaS Binding Assay: [35S]GTP gamma S functional assays were conducted using freshly thawed mu-receptor membranes.

The prepared membrane solution (1904/well) was transferred to 96-shallow well polypropylene plates containing 10 uL of 20x concentrated stock solutions of the agonist DAMGO ([D-Ala2, N-methyl-Phe4 Gly-ol5]-enkephalin) prepared in DMSO. Plates were incubated for 30 min at about 25 C. with shaking. Reactions were terminated by rapid filtration onto 96-well Unifilter GF/B filter plates (Packard, Meriden, Conn.) using a 96-well tissue harvester (Brandel, Gaithersburg, Md.) followed by three filtration washes with 200 mL of ice-cold wash buffer.

The prepared membrane solution (190 uL/well) was transferred to 96-shallow well polypropylene plates containing 10 xL of 20x concentrated stock solutions of agonist prepared in DMSO. Plates were incubated for 30 min at a temperature of about 25 C. with shaking. Reactions were terminated by rapid filtration onto 96-well Unifilter GF/B filter plates (Packard) using a 96-well tissue harvester (Packard) and followed by three filtration washes with 200 uL ice-cold binding buffer (10 mM NaH2PO4, 10 mM Na2HPO4, pH 7.4). Filter plates were subsequently dried at 50 C.
35S-GTPgammaS Binding: Measurements of 35S-GTPgammaS Binding: Membranes (1 to 10 ug protein) prepared as described above, were incubated in 96-well Scintiplates (PerkinElmer) with test compounds diluted in DMSO, in 180 ul of 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mM MgCl2, 2 ug/well Saponin, 0.2% fatty acid free BSA (Assay buffer), 140 mM NaCl and 1.7 uM GDP. The assay was initiated with the addition of 20 ul of 1.5 nM [35S]-GTPgammaS (1100 Ci/mmol; GE Healthcare) in assay buffer. After 60 min incubation at 30° C. on a shaker, plates were centrifuged for 10 min at 2000 RPM. Supernatant was discarded and membrane bound radioactivity was measured on a PerkinElmer 1450 MicroBeta counter. Triplicate samples were averaged and expressed as % response relative to S1P activation in absence of compound (n=2).
cAMP GloSensor Assay: HEK293T cells co-expressing the cAMP biosensor GloSensor-22F (Promega) and hD2 receptors were seeded (10,000 cells/20 ul/well) into white, clear-bottom, tissue culture plates in HBSS, 10% FBS, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4. After a one- to two-hour recovery, cells were treated with 10 ul of 3x test or reference drug prepared in HBSS, 10% FBS, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4. After 30 minutes, cells were challenged with 10 ul of 1,200 nM (4x) isoproterenol in 8% (4x) GloSensor reagent. Luminescence per well per second was read on a Wallac TriLux microbeta plate counter. Data were normalized to the isoproterenol response (100%) and the maximal quinpirole-induced inhibition thereof (0%) and regressed using the sigmoidal dose-response function built into GraphPad Prism 4.0. Notably, HEK293T cells expressing the GloSensor-22F alone (no hD2) were assayed in parallel and displayed no inhibition of isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP.
Beta-Arrestin Recruitment (Tango) Assay: Recruitment of β-arrestin to agonist-stimulated D2 receptors was performed using a previously described Tango-type assay (Barnea et al., Proc. Natl. Acad.

Briefly, HTLA cells stably expressing β-arrestin-TEV protease and a tetracycline transactivator-driven luciferase were plated in 15-cm dishes in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and transfected (via calcium phosphate) with 20 μg of a D2V2-TCS-tTA construct (Barnea et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 105:64 (2008)). The next day, cells were plated in white, clear-bottom, 384-well plates (Greiner, 10,000 cells/well, 50 μl/well) in DMEM containing 1% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. The following day, the cells were challenged with 10 μl/well of reference agonist (6 μM) or D2 test ligand (6 μM)±reference agonist prepared in HBS, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 18% DMSO (final ligand concentrations were 1 μM, final DMSO concentration was 3%).

Fifty μl/well scintillation cocktail (Perkin Elmer, Shelton, Conn.) was added and plates were counted in a Packard Top-Count for 1 min/well.
Fluorescence Laser Imaging Plate Reader (FLIPR) Based Assay: The compounds of the present invention may be tested in a fluorescence laser imaging plate reader (FLIPR) based assay. This assay is a common functional assay to monitor Ca2+ mobilization in whole cells expressing recombinant receptor coupled with a promiscuous G-protein. CHO dhfr-cells stably expressing recombinant human mGluR2 and Gα16 loaded with Fluo-4 AM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad Calif.) are treated with dose responses of compounds and the Ca2+ response is monitored on a FLIPR384 (Molecular Devices, Sunnydale Calif.) for agonist activity. The potentiation response is monitored after a subsequent addition of an EC20 concentration of glutamate (900 nM).
[35S]-GTPγS Assay: The stimulation of [35S]-GTPγS binding is a common functional assay to monitor Gαi-coupled receptor in native and recombinant receptor membrane preparation. Membrane from cells stably expressing hmGlu2 CHO-K1 (50 μg) are incubated in a 96 well plate for 1 hour in the presence of GTPγS35 (0.05 nM), GDP (5 μM) and compounds. The reaction is stopped by rapid filtration over Unifilter GF/B plate (Packard, Bioscience, Meriden Conn.) using a 96-well cell harvester (Brandel Gaithersburg, Md.). The filter plates are counted using Topcount counter (Packard, Bioscience, Meriden Conn., USA). When compounds are evaluated as potentiators they are tested in the presence of glutamate (1 μM).
Intracellular Ca2+ Mobilization Assay: A monoclonal HEK-293 cell line stably transfected with a cDNA encoding for the human mGlu5a receptor was generated; for the work with mGlu5 Positive Allosteric Modulators (PAMs), a cell line with low receptor expression levels and low constitutive receptor activity was selected to allow the differentiation of agonistic versus PAM activity. Cells were cultured according to standard protocols (Freshney, 2000) in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium with high glucose supplemented with 1 mM glutamine, 10% (vol/vol) heat-inactivated bovine calf serum, Penicillin/Streptomycin, 50 μg/ml hygromycin and 15 μg/ml blasticidin (all cell culture reagents and antibiotics from Invitrogen, Basel, Switzerland). About 24 hrs before an experiment, 5×104 cells/well were seeded in poly-D-lysine coated, black/clear-bottomed 96-well plates. The cells were loaded with 2.5 μM Fluo-4AM in loading buffer (1×HBSS, 20 mM HEPES) for 1 hr at 37 °C. and washed five times with loading buffer. The cells were transferred into a Functional Drug Screening System 7000 (Hamamatsu, Paris, France), and 11 half logarithmic serial dilutions of test compound at 37 °C. were added and the cells were incubated for 10-30 min. with on-line recording of fluorescence. Following this pre-incubation step, the agonist L-glutamate was added to the cells at a concentration corresponding to EC20 (typically around 80 μM) with on-line recording of fluorescence; in order to account for day-to-day variations in the responsiveness of cells, the EC20 of glutamate was determined immediately ahead of each experiment by recording of a full dose-response curve of glutamate.
GTPγ[35S] Functional Assay: Functional activity was evaluated using GTPγ[35S] assay in CHO membrane extracts expressing recombinant hCB1 (human CB1) receptors or hCB2 (human CB2) receptors. The assay relies on the binding of GTPγ[35S], a radiolabeled nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue, to the G protein upon binding of an agonist of the G-protein-coupled receptor. In this system, agonists stimulate GTPγ[35S] binding whereas neutral antagonist have no effect and inverse agonists decrease GTPγ[35S] basal binding.
cAMP Assay: EP4 receptors couple to Gs and mediate elevations in cAMP concentration, although they do participate in other pathways as well. There are some redundancies in function between EP2 and EP4 receptors. For example, both receptors induce PGE2-mediated RANKL through cAMP.
Radioligand Binding: HEK-293 cells stably expressing the human or feline FP receptor, or EP1, EP2, or EP4 receptors were washed with TME buffer, scraped from the bottom of the flasks, and homogenized for 30 sec using a Brinkman PT 10/35 polytron. TME buffer was added to achieve a final 40 ml volume in the centrifuge tubes (the composition of TME is 100 mM TRIS base, 20 mM MgCl2, 2M EDTA; 10N HCl is added to achieve a pH of 7.4). The cell homogenate was centrifuged at 19000 r.p.m. for 20 min at 4 °C. using a Beckman Ti-60 rotor. The resultant pellet was resuspended in TME buffer to give a final 1 mg/ml protein concentration, as determined by Biorad assay. Radioligand binding competition assays vs. [3H-]17-phenyl PGF2a (5 nM) were performed in a 100 μl volume for 60 min. Binding reactions were started by adding plasma membrane fraction. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 4 ml ice-cold TRIS-HCl buffer and rapid filtration through glass fiber GF/B filters using a Brandel cell harvester. The filters were washed 3 times with ice-cold buffer and oven dried for one hour. [3H−] PGE2 (specific activity 180 Ci mmol) was used as the radioligand for EP receptors.

A 200 μl assay volume was used. Incubations were for 60 min at 25 °C. and were terminated by the addition of 4 ml of ice-cold 50 mM TRIS-HCl, followed by rapid filtration through Whatman GF/B filters and three additional 4 ml washes in a cell harvester (Brandel). Competition studies were performed using a final concentration of 5 nM [3H]-PGE2, or 5 nM [3H] 17-phenyl PGF2a and non-specific binding determined with 10^−5M of unlabeled PGE2, or 17-phenyl PGF2a, according to receptor subtype studied.
[35S]GTPγS Functional Assay: [35S]GTPγS functional assays were conducted using freshly thawed p-receptor membranes prepared in-house from a cell line expressing recombinant μ opioid receptor in a HEK-293, CHO or U-2 OS cell background, or purchased from a commercial source (Perkin Elmer, Shelton.

[35S]GTPγS Functional Assay: Functional [35S]GTPγS binding assays were conducted as follows. κ opioid receptor membrane solution was prepared by sequentially adding final concentrations of 0.026 μg/μl κ membrane protein (in-house), 10 μg/mL saponin, 3 μM GDP and 0.20 nM [35S]GTPγS to binding buffer (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) on ice. The prepared membrane solution (190 μl/well) was transferred to 96-shallow well polypropylene plates containing 10 μl of 20× concentrated stock solutions of agonist prepared in DMSO. Plates were incubated for 30 min at a temperature of about 25° C. with shaking. Reactions were terminated by rapid filtration onto 96-well Unifilter GF/B filter plates (Perkin Elmer, Shelton, Conn.) using a 96-well tissue harvester (Packard) and followed by three filtration washes with 200 μl ice-cold binding buffer (10 mM NaH2PO4, 10 mM Na2HPO4, pH 7.4). Filter plates were subsequently dried at 50° C. for 2-3 hours.
Intracellular Calcium Assay: Cells expressing recombinant human ALX receptor and the G-protein Gα16 (HEK293-hALXR-Gα16) were grown to 80% confluency in Growing Medium (GM). Cells were detached from culture dishes with a cell dissociation buffer (Invitrogen, 13151-014), and collected by centrifugation at 1,000 rpm at rt for 5 min in Assay Buffer (AB) (equal parts of Hank's BSS (Gibco, 14065-049) and DMEM without Phenol Red (Gibco, 11880-028)). After 60 min incubation at 37° C. under 5% CO2 in AB supplemented with 1 μM Fluo-4 (AM) (Invitrogen, F14202) and 20 mM HEPES (Gibco, 15630-056), the cells were washed and resuspended in AB. They were then seeded onto 384-well FLIPR assay plates (Greiner, 781091) at 50,000 cells in 70 μl per well and sedimented by centrifugation at 1,000 rpm for 1 min. Stock solutions of test compounds were made up at a concentration of 10 mM in DMSO, and serially diluted in AB to concentrations required for activation dose response curves.
Transactivation Assay: The products are dissolved at 10 mM in DMSO. They are tested as a response dose at 0.1% of DMSO final. The range comprising 10 points and a zero starts at 10 μM with four-fold dilutions. To test agonists, the products are tested alone. To determine the antagonist behaviour, the products of interest are tested in the presence of 1 nM NDP-MSH (reference agonist). The cells are inoculated at a rate of 5000 cells per well (384-well plate) in serum-free DMEM medium and incubated overnight at 37° C. and 5% CO2. The products and the reference ligand (NDP-MSH) are added the following day and the plates are reincubated for 6 hours at 37° C. and 5% CO2. After adding the lysis buffer containing luciferin, the plates are read in a Top-Count machine.
Intracellular Ca2+ Mobilization Assay: A monoclonal HEK-293 cell line stably transfected with a cDNA encoding for the human mGlu5a receptor was generated; for the work with mGlu5 Positive Allosteric Modulators (PAMs), a cell line with low receptor expression levels and low constitutive receptor activity was selected to allow the differentiation of agonistic versus PAM activity. Cells were cultured according to standard protocols (Freshney, 2000) in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium with high glucose supplemented with 1 mM glutamine, 10% (vol/vol) heat-inactivated bovine calf serum, Penicillin/Streptomycin, 50 μg/ml hygromycin and 15 μg/ml blasticidin (all cell culture reagents and antibiotics from Invitrogen, Basel, Switzerland). bout 24 hrs before an experiment, 5×10^4 cells/well were seeded in poly-D-lysine coated, black/clear-bottomed 96-well plates. The cells were loaded with 2.5 μM Fluo-4AM in loading buffer (1×HBSS, 20 mM HEPES) for 1 hr at 37° C. and washed five times with loading buffer. The cells were transferred into a Functional Drug Screening System 7000 (Hamamatsu, Paris, France), and 11 half logarithmic serial dilutions of test compound at 37° C. were added and the cells were incubated for 10-30 min. with on-line recording of fluorescence. Following this pre-incubation step, the agonist L-glutamate was added to the cells at a concentration corresponding to EC20 (typically around 80 Î¼M) with on-line recording of fluorescence; in order to account for day-to-day variations in the responsiveness of cells, the EC20 of glutamate was determined immediately ahead of each experiment by recording of a full dose-response curve of glutamate.
Binding Assay: For binding experiments, cDNA encoding human mGlu 5a receptor was transiently transfected into EBNA cells using a procedure described by Schlaeger and Christensen [Cytotechnology 15:1-13 (1998)]. Cell membrane homogenates were stored at −80° C. until the day of assay where upon they were thawed and resuspended and polytronised in 15 mM Tris-HCl, 120 mM NaCl, 100 mM KCl, 25 mM CaCl2, 25 mM MgCl2 binding buffer at pH 7.4 to a final assay concentration of 20 μg protein/well.Saturation isotherms were determined by addition of twelve [3H]MPEP concentrations (0.04-100 nM) to these membranes (in a total volume of 200 μl) for 1 h at 4° C. Competition experiments were performed with a fixed concentration of [3H]MPEP (2 nM) and IC50 values of test compounds evaluated using 11 concentrations (0.3-10,000 nM). Incubations were performed for 1 h at 4° C.
Affinity Assay: Each medicament was dissolved in serum-free F12 culture medium containing 100 μM of IBMX. CHO cells which can stably express D2 receptor were pre-incubated at 37° C. for 10 min, and then 10 μM Forskoline and 10 μM Dopanie were added at the same time to react for 10 min. 100 μL, of pre-cooled 1 M of HClO4 was added and the reaction was terminated at 4° C. for 1 hour. 20 μL of 2 M K2CO3 was added to neutralize the reaction. The resulting mixture was centrifugated at 3000 rpm for 15 min, and the precipitate KClO4 was discarded. A certain amount of the supernatant was taken for cAMP detection. Spiperone and Quinpirole were used as positive control.
[35S]GTPγS Binding Assay: For detecting the agonism action of the compounds, the [35S]GTPγS binding assay was performed at 30° C. for 40 mins in reaction buffer containing 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl and 1 mM (DL)-dithiothreitol (DTT). The assay mixture (200 μL) contained 30 μg of membraneprotein, 0.1 nM [35S]GTPγS, and 40 μM guanosine triphosphate (GDP) with various concentration of the compound. The D1 receptor agonist SKF38393 and sntagonist SCH23390 were used for reference. Non specific binding was measured in the presence of 100 μM 50-guanylimidodiphosphate (Gpp(NH)p). The reaction was terminated by adding 3 mL of ice-cold washing buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, and 100 mM NaCl) and was rapidly filtered with GF/C glass fiber filters (Whatman) and rinsed for three times.

Calif.) without added antibiotics. On the day of the experiment, cells were spun at 1,000 rpm for 5 minutes at room temperature and then washed once with HBSS (HEPES Buffered Saline Solution, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.). Cells were then spun again and resuspended in stimulation buffer (HBSS with 0.05% FAF-BSA (Fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, Ind.), 5 mM HEPES) to 2 million cells per ml. Antibody supplied with the LANCE™ cAMP immunoassay kit was then added to the cells according to the manufacturer's instructions, and 12,000 cells per well were then added to the wells containing forskolin to a predetermined fixed final concentration (typically about 2.5 μM) and the previously determined amount of the synthetic peptide amide to be tested. The synthetic peptide amides were tested in a range of concentrations to determine potency. Cells were incubated with the synthetic peptide amide plus forskolin for about 20 minutes at room temperature. After incubation, cells are lysed by adding 12 μl of detection mix as supplied with the LANCE™ kit, followed by incubation for one hour at room temperature. Time resolved fluorescence was read using a 330-380 nm excitation filter, a 665 nm emission filter, dichroic mirror 380, and Z=1 mm.
